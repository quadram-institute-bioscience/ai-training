Nevertheless, its global distribution and intraspecies genomic variation remain understudied. By surveying 12,791 gut metagenomes, we recapitulated known associations with metabolic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease. We uncovered a higher prevalence and abundance of R. gnavus in Westernized populations and observed bacterial relative abundances up to 83% in newborns. Next, we built a resource of R. gnavus isolates (N = 45) from healthy individuals and Crohn's disease patients and generated complete R. gnavus genomes using PacBio circular consensus sequencing. Analysis of these genomes and publicly available high-quality draft genomes (N = 333 genomes) revealed multiple clades which separated Crohn's-derived isolates from healthy-derived isolates. Presumed R. gnavus virulence factors could not explain this separation. Bacterial genome-wide association study revealed that Crohn's-derived isolates were enriched in genes related to mobile elements and mucin foraging. Together, we present a large R. gnavus resource that will be available to the scientific community and provide novel biological insights into the global distribution and genomic variation of R. gnavus."

Its catalytic domain, belonging to glycoside hydrolase GH33 family, cleaves off terminal sialic acid residues from mucins, releasing 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac which is then used as metabolic substrate by R. gnavus to proliferate in the mucosal environment. RgNanH is one of the three intramolecular trans-sialidases (IT-sialidases) characterised to date, and the first from a gut commensal organism. Here, saturation transfer difference NMR (STD NMR) in combination with computational techniques (molecular docking and CORCEMA-ST) were used to elucidate the specificity, kinetics and relative affinity of RgNanH for sialoglycans and 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac. We propose the first 3D model for the Michaelis complex of an IT-sialidase. This confirms the sialic acid to be the main recognition element for the interaction in the enzymatic cleft and highlights the crucial role of Trp698 to make CH-π stacking with the galactose residue of the substrate 3'-sialyllactose. The same contact is shown not to be possible for 6'-sialyllactose, due to geometrical constrains of the α-2,6 linkage. Indeed 6'-sialyllactose is not a substrate, even though it is shown to bind to RgNanH by STD NMR. These findings corroborate the role of Trp698 for the α-2,3 specificity of IT-sialidases. In this structural study, the use of Differential Epitope Mapping STD NMR (DEEP-STD NMR) approach allowed the validation of the proposed 3D models in solution. These structural approaches are shown to be instrumental in shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning enzymatic reactions in the absence of enzyme-substrate X-ray structures."

Whether R. gnavus metabolites can modulate host intestinal physiology remains largely understudied. We performed untargeted metabolomic and bulk RNA-seq analyses using R. gnavus monocolonization in germ-free mice. Based on transcriptome-metabolome correlations, we tested the impact of specific arginine metabolites on intestinal epithelial production of nitric oxide (NO) and examined the effect of NO on the growth of various strains of R. gnavus in vitro and in nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2)-deficient mice. R. gnavus produces specific arginine, tryptophan, and tyrosine metabolites, some of which are regulated by the environmental richness of sialic acid and mucin. R. gnavus colonization promotes expression of amino acid transporters and enzymes involved in metabolic flux of arginine and associated metabolites into NO. R. gnavus induced elevated levels of NOS2, while Nos2 ablation resulted in R. gnavus expansion in vivo. The growth of various R. gnavus strains can be inhibited by NO. Specific R. gnavus metabolites modulate intestinal epithelial cell NOS2 abundance and reduce epithelial barrier function at higher concentrations. Intestinal colonization and interaction with R. gnavus are partially regulated by an arginine-NO metabolic pathway, whereby a balanced control by the gut epithelium may restrain R. gnavus growth in healthy individuals. Disruption in this arginine metabolic regulation will contribute to the expansion and blooming of R. gnavus."

With the advent of metagenomics, R. gnavus has been associated both positively and negatively with an increasing number of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases from inflammatory bowel diseases to neurological disorders. This prompted renewed interest in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of R. gnavus to the gut, and the molecular mediators affecting its association with health and disease. From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the biological characterization of R. gnavus, its occurrence in the infant and adult gut microbiota and the factors influencing its colonization of the gastrointestinal tract; we also discuss the current state of our knowledge on its role in host health and disease. We highlight gaps in knowledge and discuss the hypothesis that differential health outcomes associated with R. gnavus in the gut are strain and niche specific."

Twenty-two of those ORFs showed a complete coding sequence with deduced amino acid sequences displaying the highest degree of identity with α-l-fucosidases from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides caccae, Phocaeicola vulgatus, Phocaeicola dorei, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Streptococcus parasanguinis.

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown owing to a lack of suitable experimental models. Although most gut commensals are anaerobic, intestinal epithelial cells require oxygen for survival. In addition, most intestinal cell lines do not produce mucus, which provides a habitat for the microbiota. Here, we have developed a microaerobic, mucus-producing vertical diffusion chamber (VDC) model and determined the influence of Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Ruminococcus gnavus on enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection. Optimization of the culture medium enabled bacterial growth in the presence of mucus-producing T84/LS174T cells. Whereas L. reuteri diminished EPEC growth and adhesion to T84/LS174T and mucus-deficient T84 epithelia, R. gnavus only demonstrated a protective effect in the presence of LS174T cells. Reduced EPEC adherence was not associated with altered type III secretion pore formation. In addition, co-culture with L. reuteri and R. gnavus dampened EPEC-induced interleukin 8 secretion. The microaerobic mucin-producing VDC system will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms underpinning colonization resistance and aid the development of microbiota-based anti-infection strategies.

Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from R. gnavus ATCC 29149, RgGH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that RgGH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed RgGH98 affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of RgGH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of RgGH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of RgGH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that RgGH98 is part of an operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when R. gnavus ATCC 29149 is grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed RgGH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that RgGH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with RgGH98 confered R. gnavus E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data further support that the GH repertoire of R. gnavus strains enable them to colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection."
