Despite the high density of bacteria that colonize the airways, nutrient sources that sustain bacterial growth in vivo are unknown. Here we examine the role of respiratory mucins in the ecological dynamics of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiota. While P. aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins, saliva-derived anaerobes stimulated the growth of opportunistic pathogens when provided mucins as the sole carbon source. The fermentative metabolisms of these oral anaerobes generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during mucin enrichment in vitro, which were also found within expectorated sputum from CF patients. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened response to propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data support a central role for mucin fermentation in the carbon flux of the lower airways. More specifically, commensal oral bacteria may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to obtain carbon in the lung.","Data support a central role for mucin fermentation in the carbon flux of the lower airways and suggest commensal oral bacteria may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to obtain carbon in the lung."

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut microbiota in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.","A unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease is revealed."

Colonization of mucin gels by fecal bacteria was studied in vitro, using a two-stage continuous culture system, simulating conditions of nutrient availability and limitation characteristic of the proximal (vessel 1) and distal (vessel 2) colon. The establishment of bacterial communities in mucin gels was investigated by selective culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy, in association with fluorescently labeled 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes. Gel samples were also taken for analysis of mucin-degrading enzymes and measurements of residual mucin sugars. Mucin gels were rapidly colonized by heterogeneous bacterial populations, especially members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, enterobacteria, and clostridia. Intestinal bacterial populations growing on mucin surfaces were shown to be phylogenetically and metabolically distinct from their planktonic counterparts.","Mucin gels were rapidly colonized by heterogeneous bacterial populations, especially members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, enterobacteria, and clostridia, which were shown to be phylogenetically and metabolically distinct from their planktonic counterparts."

This barrier function is due in part to the extensive glycan structures found in mucus. Mucin protein is heavily O‐glycosylated with core structures containing α‐ and β‐ linked N‐acetyl‐galactosamine, N‐acetyl‐glucosamine, and galactose. These core structures are elongated and commonly modified by α‐linked fucose, sialic acid and sulfate residues. The sialic acid and sulfate residues protect the underlying mucin glycans from degradation. However, some gut microbes harbor glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) that enzymatically degrade mucin glycans. The released oligosaccharides can then be used as a primary carbohydrate source for the mucus‐associated microbiota.

Mucins are complex glycoproteins that contain heavily sulfated O-glycans and form the protective colonic mucus layer. Bacterial carbohydrate sulfatases are required to metabolise these heavily sulfated mucin glycans and excessive bacterial foraging has been associated with several diseases. Sulfatases have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease, making these microbiota enzymes potential drug targets. A. muciniphila expresses carbohydrate sulfatases that can act on colonic mucins yet their roles in its metabolism remain opaque. Our data reveal that A. muciniphila requires glycopeptides/protein forms of colonic mucin for metabolism and its sulfatases have unique adaptations compared to Bacteroides species. Localisation studies reveal that desulfation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, but not D-galactose, is exclusively periplasmic. A cell surface sulfatase has a novel carbohydrate binding module that binds to colonic mucin.

They are associated with perturbation of the intestinal microbiota, and with alteration and crossing of the mucus barrier by the commensal bacteria that feed on it. In the process of mucus catabolism and invasion by gut bacteria, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play a critical role since mucus is mainly made up by O- and N-glycans. Moreover, the occurrence of IBD seems to be associated with low-fiber diets. Conversely, supplementation with oligosaccharides, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are structurally similar to intestinal mucins and could thus compete with them towards bacterial mucus-degrading CAZymes, has been suggested to prevent inflammation. In this mini-review, we will establish the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens, with a particular focus on the present technological opportunities available to further the discovery of mucus-degrading CAZymes within the entire gut microbiome, by coupling microfluidics with metagenomics and culturomics. Finally, we will discuss the challenges to overcome to better assess how CAZymes targeting specific functional oligosaccharides could be involved in the modulation of the mucus-driven cross-talk between gut bacteria and their host in the context of IBD.","In this article , the authors present the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens."

We heterologously expressed and purified RgGH98, and determined its substrate and linkage specificity. We showed that RgGH98 is specific for blood group A antigen (BgA), as also confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, revealing affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of RgGH98 specificity was further investigated using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of the complex between RgGH98 and BgA trisaccharide and RgGH98 inactive mutant with BgA tetrasaccharide identified residues involved in RgGH98 unique specificity. RNAseq and qPCR analysis showed that the gene encoding RgGH98 is part of an operon that is overexpresssed in vitro when R. gnavusis grown on mucin as sole carbon source.

However, MD bacterial physiology and metabolism remain elusive. Here, we assessed functional modules of mucin catabolism, through a comprehensive bioinformatics-aided functional annotation, to identify 54 A. muciniphila genes and 296 R. gnavus genes. The reconstructed core metabolic pathways coincided with the growth kinetics and fermentation profiles of A. muciniphila and R. gnavus grown in the presence of mucin and its constituents. Genome-wide multi-omics analyses validated the nutrient-dependent fermentation profiles of the MD bacteria and identified their distinct mucolytic enzymes. The distinct metabolic features of the two MD bacteria induced differences in the metabolite receptor levels and inflammatory signals of the host immune cells. In addition, in vivo experiments and community-scale metabolic modeling demonstrated that different dietary intakes influenced the abundance of MD bacteria, their metabolic fluxes, and gut barrier integrity. Thus, this study provides insights into how diet-induced metabolic differences in MD bacteria determine their distinct physiological roles in the host immune response and the gut ecosystem.","In this paper , a comprehensive bioinformatics-aided functional annotation was performed to identify 54 Akkermansia muciniphila and 296 Ruminococcus gnavus genes."

Gut mucin degraders of healthy subjects were investigated, through a culture dependent and independent approach. The faeces of five healthy adults were subjected to three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources. The bacterial community was compared before and after the enrichment by 16S rRNA gene profiling. Bacteria capable of fermenting sugars, such as Anaerotruncus, Holdemania, and Enterococcaceae likely took advantage of the carbohydrate chains. Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae, Peptococcales, the Coriobacteriale Eggerthella, and a variety of Clostridia such as Oscillospiraceae, Anaerotruncus, and Lachnoclostridium, significantly increased and likely participated to the degradation of the protein backbone of mucin. The affinity of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae for mucin may facilitate the access to the gut mucosa, promoting gut barrier damage and triggering systemic inflammatory responses. Only three species of strict anaerobes able to grow on mucin were isolated from the enrichments of five different microbiota: Clostridium disporicum, Clostridium tertium, and Paraclostridium benzoelyticum. The limited number of species isolated confirms that in the gut the degradation of these glycoproteins results from cooperation and cross-feeding among several species exhibiting different metabolic capabilities.","In this paper, Gut mucin degraders of healthy subjects were investigated, through a culture dependent and independent approach, through three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources."

Some of these mucosal residents thrive on mucin glycoproteins that make up this layer. Mucin glycan degraders release mono- and oligosaccharides, and produce metabolites and gases that can be used by other inhabitants of the mucus layer through cross-feeding. In this thesis, I studied the collective mucin glycan degradation by a network of interacting microbes. To do that, I created a microbial mucin-degrading synthetic community (MDSC) and studied its composition and function during growth on mucin. This revealed that all mucin glycan degraders could co-exist, and that they could sustain butyrate-producing and hydrogen-consuming organisms. I show that a large number of diverse glycan-degrading enzymes encoded by different bacteria is involved in mucin glycan degradation. Throughout this thesis, specialist mucin glycan degrader Akkermansia muciniphila played a central role. When present from the start in a synthetic community growing on mucin, it was the dominant organism. Even when it was added after stabilisation of the synthetic community, to simulate probiotic treatment, A. muciniphila was able to colonise and persist. Furthermore, in a synthetic community that was designed to model the developing infant gut microbiota, the mucin specificity of A. muciniphila was again confirmed, as it only grew in the presence of mucin and not with any of the other substrates. A comparison of A. muciniphila to fellow specialist mucin glycan degrader Ruminococcus torques and glycan generalist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron revealed that each mucin glycan degrader has distinct preferences for specific mucin glycan structures. Consequently, growing the synthetic community on different mucin types affected community composition and function. This thesis demonstrates the utility of synthetic communities for microbial ecophysiological research, and contributes another piece to the puzzle of the ecological interactions that occur between the microbes that call the mucus layer their home.

We previously showed that the ability of R. gnavus to forage on mucins is strain-dependent and associated with sialic acid metabolism. Here, we showed that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free (GF) mice. Changes in metabolites associated with brain function such as tryptamine, indolacetate, and trimethylamine N-oxide were also detected in the cecal content of Rg-mice when compared to GF mice. Next, we investigated the effect of R. gnavus monocolonization on hippocampus cell proliferation and behavior. We observed a significant decrease of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Rg-mice as compared to GF mice and recruitment of phagocytic microglia in the vicinity. Behavioral assessments suggested an improvement of the spatial working memory in Rg-mice but no change in other cognitive functions. These results were also supported by a significant upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and neuroplasticity. Collectively, these data provide first insights into how R. gnavus metabolites may influence brain regulation and function through modulation of granule cell development and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus. This work has implications for further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the role of R. gnavus in neurological disorders.","It is shown that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free mice."

Colonic mucus consists of a loose outer layer and a dense epithelium-attached layer. The outer layer is inhabited by various representatives of the human gut microbiota (HGM). Glycans of the colonic mucus can be used by the HGM as a source of carbon and energy when dietary fibers are not sufficiently available. Here, we analyzed 397 individual HGM genomes to identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides. Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, whereas genes for the catabolism of derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (ii) Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of monosaccharide transporters. (iii) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes may be involved in exchange pathways for the monosaccharides derived from cleaved mucin glycans.

While R. gnavus is not considered a pathogen, overabundance of this species is correlated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), and its sialic acid metabolism may play a role in the dysbiotic state. Interestingly, liberation of mucin-bound sialic acid by R. gnavus yields the distinct product of 2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), in contrast to other known mucin-degrading bacteria, which generate Neu5Ac. This prompted us to look for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism proteins in the genomes of 77 R. gnavus clinical isolates. We found that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism is sporadically distributed in this species with respect to phylogeny and strain origin. We measured sialic acid-dependent growth of 12 sequenced isolates, finding that the presence of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism proteins was predictive of growth on this substrate. Our analysis also uncovered “partial” 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism pathways in two R. gnavus strains, which we determined constitute the canonical Neu5Ac catabolism pathway, previously unreported in this species.

The main component of the mucus are mucins, glycoproteins decorated with hundreds of different O-glycans. Some microbiota members can utilize mucin O-glycans as carbons source. To degrade these host glycans the bacteria express multiple carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) such as glycoside hydrolases, sulfatases and esterases which are active on specific linkages. The studies of these enzymes in an in vivo context have started to reveal their importance in mucin utilization and gut colonization. It is now clear that bacteria evolved multiple specific CAZymes to overcome the diversity of linkages found in O-glycans. Additionally, changes in mucin degradation by gut microbiota have been associated with diseases like obesity, diabetes, irritable bowel disease and colorectal cancer.

Certain residents of this niche can degrade the large and complex mucin glycoproteins that constitute this layer and utilise the degradation products for their metabolism. In turn, this microbial mucin degradation drives specific microbiological ecological interactions in the human gut mucus layer. However, the exact nature of these interactions remains unknown. In this study, we designed and studied an in vitro mucin-degrading synthetic community that included mucin O-glycan degraders and cross-feeding microorganisms by monitoring community composition and dynamics through a combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, mucin glycan degradation with PGC-LC-MS/MS, production of mucin-degrading enzymes and other proteins through metaproteomics, and metabolite production with HPLC. We demonstrated that specialist and generalist mucin O-glycan degraders stably co-exist and found evidence for cross-feeding relationships. Cross-feeding on the products of mucin degradation by other gut microbes resulted in butyrate production, hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis.

Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins may serve as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we investigate the potential role of purified, orally-administered mucus glycans in maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and purified O-linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic treatment, suppress C. difficile abundance, delay the onset of diet-induced obesity, and increase relative abundance of resident Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being selected for during host development and throughout evolution of the host-microbe relationship.

We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from R. gnavus ATCC 29149, RgGH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that RgGH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II).

The thick intestinal mucus layer, especially in the colon, is the key barrier between the contents of the lumen and the epithelial cells, providing protection against infiltration by the microbiota as well potential pathogens. The upper layer of the colonic mucus is a niche for a subset of the microbiota which utilise the mucin glycoproteins as a nutrient source and mucin grazing by the microbiota appears to play a key role in maintaining barrier function as well as community stability. Despite the importance of mucin breakdown for gut health, the mechanisms by which gut bacteria access this complex glycoprotein are not well understood. The current model for mucin degradation involves exclusively exo-acting glycosidases that sequentially trim monosaccharides from the termini of the glycan chains to eventually allow access to the mucin peptide backbone by proteases. However, this model is in direct contrast to the Sus paradigm of glycan breakdown used by the Bacteroidetes which involves extracellular cleavage of glycans by surface located endo-acting enzymes prior to import of the oligosaccharide products. Here we describe the discovery and characterisation of endo-acting family 16 glycoside hydrolases (GH16s) from prominent mucin degrading gut bacteria that specifically target the oligosaccharide side chains of intestinal mucins from both animals and humans.

Furthermore, B. thetaiotaomicron significantly upregulated the expression of a gene encoding for membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain in co-culture. The transcriptome analysis also indicated that A. muciniphila was less affected by the environmental changes and was able to sustain its abundance in the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron while increasing the expression of LPS core biosynthesis activity encoding genes (O-antigen ligase, Lipid A and Glycosyl transferases) as well as ABC transporters.

Cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase were present in bacteria growing at all levels of fecal inocula, including 10(-11) g. In contrast, extracellular activities were present in every culture inoculated with 10(-4)-10(-7) g feces, but were diminished or absent in cultures inoculated with 10(-8)-10(-11) g feces. Bacterial autolysis was an unlikely cause of extracellular glycosidase activity, since p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-fucosidase remained cell bound in cultures at every level of fecal inoculum. Degradation of mucin oligosaccharides was associated with extracellular, but not with cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase. Among the seven subjects, the estimated most probable numbers (MPN) of fecal bacteria producing extracellular beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase ranged from 10(6)-10(10)/g dry fecal wt, were comparable to the MPN of mucin-degrading bacteria, and were significantly smaller than the MPN of total fecal bacteria. We interpret these findings as evidence for the existence of bacterial subpopulations in the normal fecal flora that produce extracellular glycosidases, and that these subpopulations have a major role in degrading the complex oligosaccharides of mucin in the gut lumen.","Findings are interpreted as evidence for the existence of bacterial subpopulations in the normal fecal flora that produce extracellular glycosidases, and that theseSubpopulations have a major role in degrading the complex oligosaccharides of mucin in the gut lumen."

Like microorganisms adapted to other complex nutrient environments, gut symbionts give different metabolic priorities to substrates present in mixtures. We investigated the responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common human intestinal bacterium that metabolizes more than a dozen different polysaccharides, including the O-linked glycans that are abundant in secreted mucin. Experiments in which mucin glycans were presented simultaneously with other carbohydrates show that degradation of these host carbohydrates is consistently repressed in the presence of alternative substrates, even by B. thetaiotaomicron previously acclimated to growth in pure mucin glycans. Experiments with media containing systematically varied carbohydrate cues and genetic mutants reveal that transcriptional repression of genes involved in mucin glycan metabolism is imposed by simple sugars and, in one example that was tested, is mediated through a small intergenic region in a transcript-autonomous fashion. Repression of mucin glycan-responsive gene clusters in two other human gut bacteria, Bacteroides massiliensis and Bacteroides fragilis, exhibited variable and sometimes reciprocal responses compared to those of B. thetaiotaomicron, revealing that these symbionts vary in their preference for mucin glycans and that these differences occur at the level of controlling individual gene clusters. Our results reveal that sensing and metabolic triaging of glycans are complex processes that vary among species, underscoring the idea that these phenomena are likely to be hidden drivers of microbiota community dynamics and may dictate which microorganisms preferentially commit to various niches in a constantly changing nutritional environment. IMPORTANCE Human intestinal microorganisms impact many aspects of health and disease, including digestion and the propensity to develop disorders such as inflammation and colon cancer. Complex carbohydrates are a major component of the intestinal habitat, and numerous species have evolved and refined strategies to compete for these coveted nutrients. Our findings reveal that individual bacteria exhibit different preferences for carbohydrates emanating from host diet and mucosal secretions and that some of these prioritization strategies are opposite to one another. Thus, we reveal new aspects of how individual bacteria, some with otherwise similar metabolic potential, partition to “preferred niches” in the complex gut ecosystem, which has important and immediate implications for understanding and predicting the behavioral dynamics of this community.","Investigating the responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common human intestinal bacterium that metabolizes more than a dozen different polysaccharides, reveals new aspects of how individual bacteria partition to “preferred niches” in the complex gut ecosystem, which has important and immediate implications for understanding and predicting the behavioral dynamics of this community."

Colonic mucus consists of a loose outer layer and a dense epithelium-attached layer. The outer layer is inhabited by various representatives of the human gut microbiota (HGM). Glycans of the colonic mucus can be used by the HGM as a source of carbon and energy when dietary fibers are not sufficiently available. Both commensals and pathogens can utilize mucin glycans. Commensals are mostly involved in the cleavage of glycans, while pathogens mostly utilize monosaccharides released by commensals. This HGM-derived degradation of the mucus layer increases pathogen susceptibility and causes many other health disorders. Here, we analyzed 397 individual HGM genomes to identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides. Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, which significantly higher than a previous estimation. (ii) Genes for the catabolism of derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (iii) Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of monosaccharide transporters. (iv) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes may be involved in potential feeding pathways for the monosaccharides derived from cleaved mucin glycans. (v) The analyzed genomes demonstrated different abilities to degrade known mucin glycans. Generally, the ability to degrade at least one type of mucin glycan was predicted for 81% of the analyzed genomes. (vi) Eighty-two percent of the analyzed genomes can form mutualistic pairs that are able to degrade mucin glycans and are not degradable by any of the paired organisms alone.

In particular, some gut bacteria have the ability to forage on glycans provided by the mucus layer covering the GI tract. The O-glycan structures present in mucin are diverse and complex, consisting predominantly of core 1-4 mucin-type O-glycans containing α- and β- linked N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine. These core structures are further elongated and frequently modified by fucose and sialic acid sugar residues via α1,2/3/4 and α2,3/6 linkages, respectively. The ability to metabolize these mucin O-linked oligosaccharides is likely to be a key factor in determining which bacterial species colonise the mucosal surface. Due to their proximity to the immune system, mucin-degrading bacteria are in a prime location to influence the host response. However, despite the growing number of bacterial genome sequences available from mucin degraders, our knowledge on the structural requirements for mucin degradation by gut bacteria remains fragmented. This is largely due to the limited number of functionally characterized enzymes and the lack of studies correlating the specificity of these enzymes with the ability of the strain to degrade and utilize mucin and mucin glycans.

Using anaerobic individual and co-cultures of R. bromii and R. gnavus grown on mucin or starch as sole carbon source, we showed that starch degradation by R. bromii supported the growth of R. gnavus whereas R. bromii did not benefit from mucin degradation by R. gnavus. Further we analyzed the growth (quantitative PCR), metabolite production (1H NMR analysis), and bacterial transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) of R. bromii cultured with RS or soluble starch (SS) in the presence or absence of R. gnavus. In co-culture fermentations on starch, 1H NMR analysis showed that R. gnavus benefits from transient glucose and malto-oligosaccharides released by R. bromii upon starch degradation, producing acetate, formate, and lactate as main fermentation end-products. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) on starch (SS and RS) showed that the presence of R. bromii induced changes in R. gnavus transcriptional response of genes encoding several maltose transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism such as maltose phosphorylase, in line with the ability of R. gnavus to utilize R. bromii starch degradation products. In the RS co-culture, R. bromii showed a significant increase in the induction of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes and a decrease of vitamin B12 (VitB12)-dependent methionine biosynthesis as compared to the mono-culture, suggesting that Trp and VitB12 availability become limited in the presence of R. gnavus. Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R. gnavus population inhabiting the mucus niche may be modulated by the supply of non-digestible carbohydrates reaching the colon such as RS.","Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R.

While R. gnavus is not considered a pathogen, overabundance of this species is correlated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its sialic acid metabolism may play a role in the dysbiotic state. Interestingly, liberation of mucin-bound sialic acid by R. gnavus yields the distinct product of 2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), in contrast to other known mucin-degrading bacteria, which generate Neu5Ac. This prompted us to look for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism proteins in the genomes of 77 R. gnavus clinical isolates. We found that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism is sporadically distributed in this species with respect to phylogeny and strain origin. We measured sialic acid-dependent growth of 12 sequenced isolates, finding that the presence of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism proteins was predictive of growth on this substrate. Our analysis also uncovered ""partial"" 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism pathways in two R. gnavus strains, leading to the discovery that these strains grow with Neu5Ac as a sole carbon source, a metabolic capability previously unreported in this species. These results reveal a notable diversity of sialic acid catabolism across the R. gnavus species, an essential consideration for further investigations into the importance of this metabolism in mucin degradation and in the roles of R. gnavus in IBD and other gut dysbioses. Ruminococcus gnavus is a common resident of the human gut, but often blooms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It remains unclear whether R. gnavus plays any direct role in disease occurrence. This study investigates R. gnavus utilization of sialic acid, a crucial component of host mucins, the main constituents of the mucus that lines and protects the gut. We profile variations in sialic acid metabolic pathways and growth among 77 R. gnavus strains, isolated from healthy people and individuals with IBD, discovering further diversity in sialic acid utilization than was previously appreciated.

Comparison of arylamidase and glycosidase activities in the multichamber system (MCS) and faeces showed that the predominant faecal enzymes were also produced by bacteria growing in the MCS. After 48 d operation, porcine gastric mucin (5.8 g/d) was independently fed to vessel 1. Elevated levels of volatile fatty acid (VFA) formation showed that the glycoprotein was actively fermented. The increase in carbohydrate availability as a result of breakdown of the mucin oligosaccharides stimulated bacterial growth and activities. The enzymological measurements showed that mucin increased production of both cell-bound and extracellular glycosidases, such as beta-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. Protease activities were profoundly influenced by mucin. These were largely cell-bound in non-mucin cultures but were predominantly extracellular and collagenolytic when mucin was present. Experiments with protease inhibitors showed that cysteine proteases were the major cell-bound and extracellular enzymes in both mucin and non-mucin cultures, but that serine and metalloproteases were also present. The effect of mucin on arylamidase formation was less marked, although there was increased production of these enzymes in vessels 1 and 2 of the MCS.

We established a link between Rg and ileal CD AIEC strain LF82 by showing that dual colonization of ex-germ-free (GF) IL10-/- mice potentiated colitis and cecal H2S production. Rg precultured mucus increased LF82 growth and H2S production, H2S supported in vitro Rg survival in minimal medium, and H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo (DDW 2023). Rg’s capsule contains glucose and has an enzyme that cleaves off sialic acid (Neu5Ac), one of the terminal carbohydrates of mucus. Because inflamed colons become microaerophilic to some extent, we focused on Rg-derived glucose and mucus-derived Neu5Ac to explore expression of LF82 molecular pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. HYPOTHESIS AIEC LF82 genes regulating growth, H2S production and virulence are differentially expressed with glucose or Neu5Ac substrates in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. METHODS LF82 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with Rg-/mucus-derived carbohydrates or gut-relevant sulfur substrates for 16 hours in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. LF82 RNA cultured with glucose or Neu5Ac medium in each condition was isolated for RNA sequencing. We compared aerobic vs. anaerobic results for each medium with |Log2FC| &amp;gt; 3.0 considered significant change. RESULTS Rg associated mucus carbohydrates and gut-relevant sulfur substrates variably enhanced LF82 growth. LF82 grew better in Neu5Ac than glucose in aerobic and vice versa in anaerobic conditions (Fig.1). Neu5Ac metabolism pathways involving nanE (N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase) and dnaA (chromosomal replication initiator), directly involved in cell replication, were overexpressed in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions in Neu5Ac medium. Additionally, expression of other Neu5Ac metabolic pathway genes, nanT (sialic transporter) and nanA (N-acetylneuraminate lyase) were slightly increased. Porin OmpC, a non-specific glucose transporter, and dnaA were more highly expressed in anaerobic than aerobic conditions in glucose medium (Table 1A). Moreover, LF82 genes involved in H2S production, biofilm formation and antimicrobial drug resistance were overexpressed in glucose vs. Neu5Ac with aerobic culture (Table 1B). CONCLUSIONS AIEC LF82 differentially uses R. gnavus released mucus components for growth in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions, and sialic acid and glucose activate distinct molecular pathways in the two conditions. Confirmatory functional experiments are underway. Glucose influences on LF82 H2S production and biofilm formation would provide strong evidence of cross-feeding between LF82 and R. gnavus, leading to potential diagnostic/treatment clues for further investigation.

In recent years, a dozen carbohydrate-active enzymes from cultivated mucin degraders have been characterized. But yet, considering the fact that uncultured species predominate in the human gut microbiota, these biochemical data are far from exhaustive. In this study, we used functional metagenomics to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans. First, we performed a high-throughput screening of a fosmid metagenomic library constructed from the ileum mucosa microbiota using chromogenic substrates. The screening resulted in the isolation of 124 clones producing activities crucial in the degradation of human O- and N-glycans, namely sialidases, β-D-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, β-D-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase, and/or β-D-mannosidase. Thirteen of these clones were selected based on their diversified functional profiles and were further analyzed on a secondary screening. This step consisted of lectin binding assays to demonstrate the ability of the clones to degrade human intestinal mucus. In total, the structural modification of several mucin motifs, sialylated mucin ones in particular, was evidenced for nine clones. Sequencing their metagenomic loci highlighted complex catabolic pathways involving the complementary functions of glycan sensing, transport, hydrolysis, deacetylation, and deamination, which were sometimes associated with amino acid metabolism machinery. These loci are assigned to several Bacteroides and Feacalibacterium species highly prevalent and abundant in the gut microbiome and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans.","Functional metagenomics is used to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans."

Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins serve as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we investigate the potential role of purified, orally administered mucus glycans in maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and purified O-linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic treatment, suppress Clostridium difficile abundance, delay the onset of diet-induced obesity, and increase the relative abundance of resident Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being selected for during host development and throughout the evolution of the host–microbe relationship. Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology.","This study liberated and purified O -linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model, and identified mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology."

The Bifidobacterium strains lacked A-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the A antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. Only Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268 produced blood group B-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of B antigenic chains. When this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group B salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. The glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. In contrast, none of 16 other fecal Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bifidobacterium strains produced ABH blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five S. faecalis strains. We conclude that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. These properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group H antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group A- or B-degrading glycosidases.","It is concluded that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidase including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases."

In this work we have obtained and analyzed the draft genome sequence of another R. gnavus mucin-degrader, ATCC 35913, isolated from a healthy individual. Transcriptomics analyses of both ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 strains confirmed that the strategy utilized by R. gnavus for mucin-degradation is focused on the utilization of terminal mucin glycans. R. gnavus ATCC 35913 also encodes a predicted IT-sialidase and harbors a Nan cluster dedicated to sialic acid utilization. We showed that the Nan cluster was upregulated when the strains were grown in presence of mucin. In addition we demonstrated that both R. gnavus strains were able to grow on 2,7-anyhydro-Neu5Ac, the IT-sialidase transglycosylation product, as a sole carbon source. Taken together these data further support the hypothesis that IT-sialidase expressing gut microbes, provide commensal bacteria such as R. gnavus with a nutritional competitive advantage, by accessing and transforming a source of nutrient to their own benefit.","In this paper, the authors have obtained and analyzed the draft genome sequence of another R. gnavus mucin-degrader, ATCC 35913, isolated from a healthy individual and showed that the Nan cluster was upregulated when the strains were grown in presence of mucin."

To access this source of nutrients, gut bacteria encode α-L-fucosidases (fucosidases) which catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal α-L-fucosidic linkages. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of fucosidases from the human gut symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus. Sequence similarity network identified strain-specific fucosidases in R. gnavus ATCC 29149 and E1 strains that were further validated enzymatically against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. Using a combination of glycan microarrays, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, crystallographic and saturation transfer difference NMR approaches, we identified a fucosidase with the capacity to recognize sialic acid-terminated fucosylated glycans (sialyl Lewis X/A epitopes) and hydrolyze α1-3/4 fucosyl linkages in these substrates without the need to remove sialic acid. Molecular dynamics simulation and docking showed that 3'-Sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) could be accommodated within the binding site of the enzyme. This specificity may contribute to the adaptation of R. gnavus strains to the infant and adult gut and has potential applications in diagnostic glycomic assays for diabetes and certain cancers.","Using a combination of glycan microarrays, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, crystallographic and saturation transfer difference NMR approaches, a fucosidase is identified with the capacity to recognize sialic acid-terminatedfucosylated glycans (sialyl Lewis X/A epitopes) and hydrolyze α1–3/4 fucOSyl linkages in these substrates without the need to remove sial"

Some members of the microbiota utilise mucin glycoproteins as a nutrient source, but a detailed understanding of the mechanisms used to breakdown these complex macromolecules is lacking. Here we describe the discovery and characterisation of endo-acting enzymes from prominent mucin-degrading bacteria that target the polyLacNAc structures within oligosaccharide side chains of both animal and human mucins. These O-glycanases are part of the large and diverse glycoside hydrolase 16 (GH16) family and are often lipoproteins, indicating that they are surface located and thus likely involved in the initial step in mucin breakdown. These data provide a significant advance in our knowledge of the mechanism of mucin breakdown by the normal microbiota. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential use of these enzymes as tools to explore changes in O-glycan structure in a number of intestinal disease states. Epithelial cells that line the gut secrete complex glycoproteins that form a mucus layer to protect the gut wall from enteric pathogens. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive characterisation of endo-acting glycoside hydrolases expressed by mucin-degrading members of the microbiome that are able to cleave the O-glycan chains of a range of different animal and human mucins.","The authors provide a comprehensive characterisation of endo-acting glycoside hydrolases expressed by mucin-degrading members of the microbiome that are able to cleave the O-glycan chains of a range of different animal and human mucins."

Here we report studies characterising the saccharides released from hog gastric mucin during incubation with the extracellular enzymes in their cell-free culture supernates. We have also tested the ability of the saccharide products to support growth of larger populations of faecal bacteria. Gel exclusion chromatography of the residual mucin following bacterial growth in mucin-containing medium confirmed that MOD strains extensively degraded the carhohydrate moieties (60-96 per cent) whereas strains of bacteroides and bifidobacteria of larger faecal populations degraded the carbohydrate moieties less extensively (median loss, 29 per cent; range 8-42 per cent). Saccharides released from hog gastric niucin by MOD strain enzymes were identified by biochemical and NMR spectroscopic methods as galactose, fucose. N -acetylglucosamine. N -acetylgalactosamine and the disaccharides GalβGalNAc and Galβ3GlcNAc. Larger oligosaccharides were not recovered. Carbon-13 NMR spectra of the residual mucin were consistent with complete removal of some but not all oligosaccliaride chains. The monosaccharides but not the disaccharides were also recovered following incubation of mucin with the sterile cell-free supernate of a heavily inoculated faecal culture. Saccharides released from hog gastric mucin by partially purified culture supernate enzyincs from Ruminococcus torques strain IX-70 were 70-98 per cent utilised by larger populations of faecal bacteria during growth in culture. Bacteria growing from 1 x 10 -10 g faecal inocula from five subjects showed minimal growth in media containing intact hog gastric mucin but grew well if the mucin-containing medium was preincubated with a sterile enzyme preparation from R. torques IX-70. We conclude that glycosidases produced by MOD strains can serve a nutritionally supportive role for larger populations of enteric bacteria, especially during fasting.

Although several microbial species have been identified as mucin degraders, there are likely many other members of the healthy gut community with the capacity to degrade mucins. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota. Within the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all Akkermansia glycaniphila and muciniphila genomes harbored multiple gene copies of mucin-degrading GHs. The only representative of the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victivallales, harbored a GH profile that closely mirrored Akkermansia. In the Actinobacteria phylum, we found several Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species with mucin-degrading GHs. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermenitomonas Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species had mucin degrading GHs. Firmicutes contained Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species with mucin-degrading GHs. Interestingly, far fewer mucin-degrading GHs were observed in the Proteobacteria phylum and were found in Klebsiella, Mixta, Serratia and Enterobacter species. We confirmed the mucin-degrading capability of 23 representative gut microbes using a chemically defined media lacking glucose supplemented with porcine intestinal mucus. These data greatly expand our knowledge of microbial-mediated mucin degradation within the human gut microbiota.
