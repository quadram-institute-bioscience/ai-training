While R. gnavus is not considered a pathogen, overabundance of this species is correlated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its sialic acid metabolism may play a role in the dysbiotic state. Interestingly, liberation of mucin-bound sialic acid by R. gnavus yields the distinct product of 2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), in contrast to other known mucin-degrading bacteria, which generate Neu5Ac. This prompted us to look for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism proteins in the genomes of 77 R. gnavus clinical isolates. We found that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism is sporadically distributed in this species with respect to phylogeny and strain origin. We measured sialic acid-dependent growth of 12 sequenced isolates, finding that the presence of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism proteins was predictive of growth on this substrate. Our analysis also uncovered ""partial"" 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism pathways in two R. gnavus strains, leading to the discovery that these strains grow with Neu5Ac as a sole carbon source, a metabolic capability previously unreported in this species. These results reveal a notable diversity of sialic acid catabolism across the R. gnavus species, an essential consideration for further investigations into the importance of this metabolism in mucin degradation and in the roles of R. gnavus in IBD and other gut dysbioses. Ruminococcus gnavus is a common resident of the human gut, but often blooms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It remains unclear whether R. gnavus plays any direct role in disease occurrence. This study investigates R. gnavus utilization of sialic acid, a crucial component of host mucins, the main constituents of the mucus that lines and protects the gut. We profile variations in sialic acid metabolic pathways and growth among 77 R. gnavus strains, isolated from healthy people and individuals with IBD, discovering further diversity in sialic acid utilization than was previously appreciated. This study emphasizes that the intricate interaction between bacteria and their environment must be examined at the strain level to understand the roles of particular species in health and disease. ","Ruminococcus gnavus, a gut commensal bacterium linked to inflammatory bowel disease, exhibits strain-level variation in its ability to utilize sialic acid, a key mucin component, with some strains capable of growing on alternative carbon sources."

Transcriptomics analyses of both ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 strains confirmed that the strategy utilized by R. gnavus for mucin-degradation is focused on the utilization of terminal mucin glycans. R. gnavus ATCC 35913 also encodes a predicted IT-sialidase and harbors a Nan cluster dedicated to sialic acid utilization. We showed that the Nan cluster was upregulated when the strains were grown in presence of mucin. In addition we demonstrated that both R. gnavus strains were able to grow on 2,7-anyhydro-Neu5Ac, the IT-sialidase transglycosylation product, as a sole carbon source. Taken together these data further support the hypothesis that IT-sialidase expressing gut microbes, provide commensal bacteria such as R. gnavus with a nutritional competitive advantage, by accessing and transforming a source of nutrient to their own benefit.","In this paper, the authors have obtained and analyzed the draft genome sequence of another R. gnavus mucin-degrader, ATCC 35913, isolated from a healthy individual and showed that the Nan cluster was upregulated when the strains were grown in presence of mucin."

Here, we focused on two major human gut symbionts, the mucin-degrader Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149, and R. bromii L2-63, a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch (RS) in human colon. Using anaerobic individual and co-cultures of R. bromii and R. gnavus grown on mucin or starch as sole carbon source, we showed that starch degradation by R. bromii supported the growth of R. gnavus whereas R. bromii did not benefit from mucin degradation by R. gnavus. Further we analyzed the growth (quantitative PCR), metabolite production (1H NMR analysis), and bacterial transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) of R. bromii cultured with RS or soluble starch (SS) in the presence or absence of R. gnavus. In co-culture fermentations on starch, 1H NMR analysis showed that R. gnavus benefits from transient glucose and malto-oligosaccharides released by R. bromii upon starch degradation, producing acetate, formate, and lactate as main fermentation end-products. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) on starch (SS and RS) showed that the presence of R. bromii induced changes in R. gnavus transcriptional response of genes encoding several maltose transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism such as maltose phosphorylase, in line with the ability of R. gnavus to utilize R. bromii starch degradation products. In the RS co-culture, R. bromii showed a significant increase in the induction of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes and a decrease of vitamin B12 (VitB12)-dependent methionine biosynthesis as compared to the mono-culture, suggesting that Trp and VitB12 availability become limited in the presence of R. gnavus. Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R. gnavus population inhabiting the mucus niche may be modulated by the supply of non-digestible carbohydrates reaching the colon such as RS.","Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R.

Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from R. gnavus ATCC 29149, RgGH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that RgGH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed RgGH98 affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of RgGH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of RgGH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of RgGH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that RgGH98 is part of an operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when R. gnavus ATCC 29149 is grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed RgGH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that RgGH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with RgGH98 confered R. gnavus E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data further support that the GH repertoire of R. gnavus strains enable them to colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection.","Ruminococcus gnavus, a human gut symbiont, exhibits specificity to blood group A antigen during mucin glycan foraging, enabling niche colonization in the gastrointestinal tract through a dedicated hydrogen network of residues and operon overexpression."

Certain residents of this niche can degrade the large and complex mucin glycoproteins that constitute this layer and utilise the degradation products for their metabolism. In turn, this microbial mucin degradation drives specific microbiological ecological interactions in the human gut mucus layer. However, the exact nature of these interactions remains unknown. In this study, we designed and studied an in vitro mucin-degrading synthetic community that included mucin O-glycan degraders and cross-feeding microorganisms by monitoring community composition and dynamics through a combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, mucin glycan degradation with PGC-LC-MS/MS, production of mucin-degrading enzymes and other proteins through metaproteomics, and metabolite production with HPLC. We demonstrated that specialist and generalist mucin O-glycan degraders stably co-exist and found evidence for cross-feeding relationships. Cross-feeding on the products of mucin degradation by other gut microbes resulted in butyrate production, hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Metaproteomics analysis revealed that mucin glycan degraders Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and Ruminococcus torques together contributed 92% of the total mucin O-glycan degrading enzyme pool of this community. Furthermore, comparative proteomics showed that in response to cultivation in a community compared to monoculture, mucin glycan degraders increased carbohydrate-active enzymes whereas we also found indications for niche differentiation. These results confirm the complexity of mucin-driven microbiological ecological interactions and the intricate role of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the human gut mucus layer.

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut microbiota in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.","A unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease is revealed."

In particular, some gut bacteria have the ability to forage on glycans provided by the mucus layer covering the GI tract. The O-glycan structures present in mucin are diverse and complex, consisting predominantly of core 1-4 mucin-type O-glycans containing α- and β- linked N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine. These core structures are further elongated and frequently modified by fucose and sialic acid sugar residues via α1,2/3/4 and α2,3/6 linkages, respectively.

Here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of four healthy subjects. Four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. Three were Ruminococcus strains and two were Bifidobacterium strains. Two Ruminococcus torques strains, IX-70 and VIII-239, produced blood group A- and H-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. The Bifidobacterium strains lacked A-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the A antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. Only Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268 produced blood group B-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of B antigenic chains. When this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group B salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. The glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. In contrast, none of 16 other fecal Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bifidobacterium strains produced ABH blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five S. faecalis strains. We conclude that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. These properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group H antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group A- or B-degrading glycosidases.","It is concluded that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidase including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases."

Here we report studies characterising the saccharides released from hog gastric mucin during incubation with the extracellular enzymes in their cell-free culture supernates. We have also tested the ability of the saccharide products to support growth of larger populations of faecal bacteria. Gel exclusion chromatography of the residual mucin following bacterial growth in mucin-containing medium confirmed that MOD strains extensively degraded the carhohydrate moieties (60-96 per cent) whereas strains of bacteroides and bifidobacteria of larger faecal populations degraded the carbohydrate moieties less extensively (median loss, 29 per cent; range 8-42 per cent). Saccharides released from hog gastric niucin by MOD strain enzymes were identified by biochemical and NMR spectroscopic methods as galactose, fucose. N -acetylglucosamine. N -acetylgalactosamine and the disaccharides GalβGalNAc and Galβ3GlcNAc. Larger oligosaccharides were not recovered. Carbon-13 NMR spectra of the residual mucin were consistent with complete removal of some but not all oligosaccliaride chains. The monosaccharides but not the disaccharides were also recovered following incubation of mucin with the sterile cell-free supernate of a heavily inoculated faecal culture. Saccharides released from hog gastric mucin by partially purified culture supernate enzyincs from Ruminococcus torques strain IX-70 were 70-98 per cent utilised by larger populations of faecal bacteria during growth in culture. Bacteria growing from 1 x 10 -10 g faecal inocula from five subjects showed minimal growth in media containing intact hog gastric mucin but grew well if the mucin-containing medium was preincubated with a sterile enzyme preparation from R. torques IX-70. We conclude that glycosidases produced by MOD strains can serve a nutritionally supportive role for larger populations of enteric bacteria, especially during fasting.

Despite the high density of bacteria that colonize the lower airways, nutrient sources that sustain bacterial growth in vivo, and how those nutrients are derived, are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the possibility that mucins serve as an important carbon reservoir for the CF lung microbiota. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins in isolation, we found that anaerobic, mucin-fermenting bacteria could stimulate the robust growth of CF pathogens when provided intact mucins as a sole carbon source. 16S rRNA sequencing and enrichment culturing of sputum also identified that mucin-degrading anaerobes are ubiquitous in the airways of CF patients. The collective fermentative metabolism of these mucin-degrading communities in vitro generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during growth on mucin, and the same metabolites were also found in abundance within expectorated sputum. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened expression of genes required for the catabolism of propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data provide evidence for an important role of mucin fermenting bacteria in the carbon flux of the lower airways. More specifically, microorganisms typically defined as commensals may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to efficiently obtain carbon in the lung.","It was found that anaerobic, mucin-fermenting bacteria could stimulate the robust growth of CF pathogens when provided intact mucins as a sole carbon source, and data provide evidence for an important role of mucin fermenting bacteria in the carbon flux of the lower airways."

To reproduce some of the nutritional and pH characteristics of the large gut, each vessel had a different operating volume (0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 liter) and pH (6.0, 6.5, and 7.0). A mixture of polysaccharides and proteins was used as carbon and nitrogen sources. Measurements of H2, CH4, S2-, sulfate reduction rates, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and volatile fatty acids were made throughout the experiment. After 48 days of running, porcine gastric mucin (5.8 g/day) was independently fed to vessel 1 of the multichamber system. The mucin was extensively degraded as evidenced by the stimulation of volatile fatty acid production. In the absence of mucin, sulfate-reducing activity was comparatively insignificant and methanogenesis was the major route for the disposal of electrons. The reverse occurred upon the addition of mucin; sulfate reduction predominated and methanogenesis was completely inhibited. This was attributed to release of sulfate from the mucin which enabled SRB to outcompete methanogenic bacteria for H2. SRB stimulated by mucin were acetate-utilizing Desulfobacter spp., lactate- and H2-utilizing Desulfovibrio spp., and propionate-utilizing Desulfobulbus spp. When the mucin pump was switched off, the multichamber system reverted to a state close to its original equilibrium. These data provide further evidence that sulfated polysaccharides such as mucin may be a source of sulfate for SRB in the human large gut.","Data provide further evidence that sulfated polysaccharides such as mucin may be a source of sulfate for SRB in the human large gut."

The faeces of five healthy adults were subjected to three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources. The bacterial community was compared before and after the enrichment by 16S rRNA gene profiling. Bacteria capable of fermenting sugars, such as Anaerotruncus, Holdemania, and Enterococcaceae likely took advantage of the carbohydrate chains. Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae, Peptococcales, the Coriobacteriale Eggerthella, and a variety of Clostridia such as Oscillospiraceae, Anaerotruncus, and Lachnoclostridium, significantly increased and likely participated to the degradation of the protein backbone of mucin. The affinity of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae for mucin may facilitate the access to the gut mucosa, promoting gut barrier damage and triggering systemic inflammatory responses. Only three species of strict anaerobes able to grow on mucin were isolated from the enrichments of five different microbiota: Clostridium disporicum, Clostridium tertium, and Paraclostridium benzoelyticum. The limited number of species isolated confirms that in the gut the degradation of these glycoproteins results from cooperation and cross-feeding among several species exhibiting different metabolic capabilities.","In this paper, Gut mucin degraders of healthy subjects were investigated, through a culture dependent and independent approach, through three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources."

We previously showed that the ability of R. gnavus to forage on mucins is strain-dependent and associated with sialic acid metabolism. Here, we showed that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free (GF) mice. Changes in metabolites associated with brain function such as tryptamine, indolacetate, and trimethylamine N-oxide were also detected in the cecal content of Rg-mice when compared to GF mice. Next, we investigated the effect of R. gnavus monocolonization on hippocampus cell proliferation and behavior. We observed a significant decrease of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Rg-mice as compared to GF mice and recruitment of phagocytic microglia in the vicinity. Behavioral assessments suggested an improvement of the spatial working memory in Rg-mice but no change in other cognitive functions. These results were also supported by a significant upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and neuroplasticity. Collectively, these data provide first insights into how R. gnavus metabolites may influence brain regulation and function through modulation of granule cell development and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus. This work has implications for further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the role of R. gnavus in neurological disorders.","It is shown that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free mice."

Some of these mucosal residents thrive on mucin glycoproteins that make up this layer. Mucin glycan degraders release mono- and oligosaccharides, and produce metabolites and gases that can be used by other inhabitants of the mucus layer through cross-feeding. In this thesis, I studied the collective mucin glycan degradation by a network of interacting microbes. To do that, I created a microbial mucin-degrading synthetic community (MDSC) and studied its composition and function during growth on mucin. This revealed that all mucin glycan degraders could co-exist, and that they could sustain butyrate-producing and hydrogen-consuming organisms. I show that a large number of diverse glycan-degrading enzymes encoded by different bacteria is involved in mucin glycan degradation. Throughout this thesis, specialist mucin glycan degrader Akkermansia muciniphila played a central role. When present from the start in a synthetic community growing on mucin, it was the dominant organism. Even when it was added after stabilisation of the synthetic community, to simulate probiotic treatment, A. muciniphila was able to colonise and persist. Furthermore, in a synthetic community that was designed to model the developing infant gut microbiota, the mucin specificity of A. muciniphila was again confirmed, as it only grew in the presence of mucin and not with any of the other substrates. A comparison of A. muciniphila to fellow specialist mucin glycan degrader Ruminococcus torques and glycan generalist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron revealed that each mucin glycan degrader has distinct preferences for specific mucin glycan structures. Consequently, growing the synthetic community on different mucin types affected community composition and function. This thesis demonstrates the utility of synthetic communities for microbial ecophysiological research, and contributes another piece to the puzzle of the ecological interactions that occur between the microbes that call the mucus layer their home.

Cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase were present in bacteria growing at all levels of fecal inocula, including 10(-11) g. In contrast, extracellular activities were present in every culture inoculated with 10(-4)-10(-7) g feces, but were diminished or absent in cultures inoculated with 10(-8)-10(-11) g feces. Bacterial autolysis was an unlikely cause of extracellular glycosidase activity, since p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-fucosidase remained cell bound in cultures at every level of fecal inoculum. Degradation of mucin oligosaccharides was associated with extracellular, but not with cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase. Among the seven subjects, the estimated most probable numbers (MPN) of fecal bacteria producing extracellular beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase ranged from 10(6)-10(10)/g dry fecal wt, were comparable to the MPN of mucin-degrading bacteria, and were significantly smaller than the MPN of total fecal bacteria. We interpret these findings as evidence for the existence of bacterial subpopulations in the normal fecal flora that produce extracellular glycosidases, and that these subpopulations have a major role in degrading the complex oligosaccharides of mucin in the gut lumen.","Findings are interpreted as evidence for the existence of bacterial subpopulations in the normal fecal flora that produce extracellular glycosidases, and that theseSubpopulations have a major role in degrading the complex oligosaccharides of mucin in the gut lumen."

Despite the high density of bacteria that colonize the airways, nutrient sources that sustain bacterial growth in vivo are unknown. Here we examine the role of respiratory mucins in the ecological dynamics of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiota. While P. aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins, saliva-derived anaerobes stimulated the growth of opportunistic pathogens when provided mucins as the sole carbon source. The fermentative metabolisms of these oral anaerobes generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during mucin enrichment in vitro, which were also found within expectorated sputum from CF patients. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened response to propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data support a central role for mucin fermentation in the carbon flux of the lower airways. More specifically, commensal oral bacteria may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to obtain carbon in the lung.","Data support a central role for mucin fermentation in the carbon flux of the lower airways and suggest commensal oral bacteria may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to obtain carbon in the lung."

Selected bacterial populations were enumerated and glycosidase, protease and arylamidase activities measured. Comparison of arylamidase and glycosidase activities in the multichamber system (MCS) and faeces showed that the predominant faecal enzymes were also produced by bacteria growing in the MCS. After 48 d operation, porcine gastric mucin (5.8 g/d) was independently fed to vessel 1. Elevated levels of volatile fatty acid (VFA) formation showed that the glycoprotein was actively fermented. The increase in carbohydrate availability as a result of breakdown of the mucin oligosaccharides stimulated bacterial growth and activities. The enzymological measurements showed that mucin increased production of both cell-bound and extracellular glycosidases, such as beta-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. Protease activities were profoundly influenced by mucin. These were largely cell-bound in non-mucin cultures but were predominantly extracellular and collagenolytic when mucin was present. Experiments with protease inhibitors showed that cysteine proteases were the major cell-bound and extracellular enzymes in both mucin and non-mucin cultures, but that serine and metalloproteases were also present. The effect of mucin on arylamidase formation was less marked, although there was increased production of these enzymes in vessels 1 and 2 of the MCS.

 Mucus-digesting Ruminococcus gnavus (R. gnavus), adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are enriched in active Crohn’s disease (CD) patients compared to healthy subjects. Dual colonization of R. gnavus and E. coli LF82 in ex-germ-free mice enhanced distal colitis and H2S production in cecal contents. R. gnavus pre-digestion of mucus enhanced the ileal CD isolate AIEC LF82 growth and H2S production in vitro. H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo along with related LF82 adhesion gene expression and Caco-2 cell expression of CEACAM6, a receptor for AIEC ligand FimH. Interactions between other CD-derived AIEC/non-AIEC and R. gnavus are unknown.
 
 
 
 Different AIEC and non-AIEC may grow and produce H2S differently using mucus digested by R. gnavus, which releases mucus-derived monosaccharides and sulfur substrates.
 
 
 
 We studied CD-derived clinical isolates of AIEC 541-15 (phylotype A), 541-1 (B1), LF82 and NRG857c (B2) and non-AIEC T75 (A) and lab strain K12 (A). M9 minimal media was supplemented with porcine gastric mucin (PGM), ileal (MIM) and colonic (MCoM) mucus isolated from germ-free mice. We measured growth kinetics and H2S production by these AIEC and non-AIEC following culture with sterile supernatants of each mucin/mucus media precultured with or without R. gnavus, monosaccharides obtained by R. gnavus digestion of mucus, and several sulfur substrates in the gut added to M9 minimal media.
 
 
 
 AIEC, especially LF82 (B2), grew better with ileal mucus aerobically and, to a lesser extent, anaerobically than non-AIEC strains, with even greater AIEC growth with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus (Fig.1). AIEC produced more H2S with R. gnavus-precultured mucus than with mucus alone. R. gnavus digestion of PGM released mucus monosaccharides (Fig.2A). AIEC strains grew differently with each monosaccharide constituent of R. gnavus pre-digested PGM. AIEC grew better than non-AIEC with each monosaccharide in aerobic conditions, but AIEC (B2) grew better than others in all monosaccharides in anaerobic conditions (Fig.2B). Amongst mucus-relevant sulfur substrates, L-cysteine was the only substrate to enhance E. coli H2S production by all AIEC and non-AIEC strains. All mucus-relevant sulfur substrates supported R. gnavus survival for 24 hrs, while H2S sustained R. gnavus for 48 hrs in minimum media.
 
 
 
 AIEC grew better and produced more H2S with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus suggesting that co-existence of AIEC with R. gnavus mutually support each other and may explain why they are often observed together in active CD patients. In addition, enhanced AIEC growth with ileal vs. colonic mucus may explain why AIEC are frequently isolated from ileal CD patients. AIEC phylotype growth differences with mucus substrates may explain their persistence in the ileal mucosa.

Mucins are decorated in a diverse array of O-glycans, providing nutrients and attachment sites for microbes. Dysbiosis of the microbiota, and alterations in mucin glycosylation have been associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, the causal relationship between these two factors remains unclear. Here, we employed a multidisciplinary approach to address this relationship, and the molecular mechanisms mediating these changes. Mucosal lavages and biopsies obtained from the sigmoid and ascending colon of patients were used to assess alterations in the mucosal microbiota and the glycosylation of associated mucus in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Secondly, in vitro growth assays and gnotobiotic mouse experiments were performed to investigate the reciprocal role of mucin-degrading bacteria in the modulation of mucin O-glycosylation.
These analyses highlighted inter-patient variability, but a similar microbial composition between colonic sites. In contrast, mucin glycosylation and the expression of glycosyltransferases was regio-specific. In UC, changes in the abundances of bacterial groups, including a decrease in the A. muciniphila to R. gnavus ratio were apparent. UC mucins displayed a decrease in fucosylation, increase in sialylation, and a decrease in many complex glycan structures found in abundance in controls. In vitro growth assays suggested that UC-like mucin glycosylation impaired A. muciniphila growth, whilst R. gnavus remained unaffected, potentially explaining changes in these species in UC. Furthermore, gnotobiotic mouse experiments showed that A. muciniphila and R. gnavus were able to remodel mucin glycosylation.
Our findings suggest a multifactorial dysregulation at the epithelial interface in IBD, where mucus-associated microbiota and mucin glycosylation are interdependent. It is likely that an initial disruption in either of these components drives alterations in other mucosal constituents, propagating disease and exacerbating inflammation.","A multifactorial dysregulation at the epithelial interface in IBD, where mucus-associated microbiota and mucin glycosylation are interdependent is suggested, likely that an initial disruption in either of these components drives alterations in other mucosal constituents, propagating disease and exacerbating inflammation."

Dietary fiber contains plant cell wall-associated polysaccharides (hemicelluloses and pectins) that are chemically diverse in composition and structure. Thus, depending on plant sources, dietary fiber daily presents the microbiota with mixtures of plant polysaccharides of various types and complexity. We studied the extent and preferential order in which mixtures of plant polysaccharides (arabinoxylan, xyloglucan, β-glucan, and pectin) were utilized by a coculture of five bacterial species (Bacteroides ovatus, Bifidobacterium longum subspecies longum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Veillonella parvula).

Five bacterial species with the capacity to degrade polymers and/or produce acidic fermentation products detectable in human feces were used in the experiments. The bacteria showed preferential use of certain polysaccharides over others for growth, and this influenced their fermentation output qualitatively. These kinds of studies are essential in developing concepts of how the gut microbial community shares habitat resources, directly and indirectly, when presented with mixtures of polysaccharides that are found in human diets. The concepts are required in planning dietary interventions that might correct imbalances in the functioning of the human microbiota so as to support measures to reduce metabolic conditions such as obesity.","A synthetic ecological community is derived that carries out SCFA production by the common pathways used by bacterial species for this purpose and might be used to predict changes to the emergent properties of the gut ecosystem when diet is altered, with the aim of beneficially affecting human physiology."

Yet the metabolic capabilities of most gut bacteria have remained unknown. Here we report growth characteristics of 96 phylogenetically diverse gut bacterial strains across 4 rich and 15 defined media. The vast majority of strains (76) grow in at least one defined medium, enabling accurate assessment of their biosynthetic capabilities. These do not necessarily match phylogenetic similarity, thus indicating a complex evolution of nutritional preferences. We identify mucin utilizers and species inhibited by amino acids and short-chain fatty acids. Our analysis also uncovers media for in vitro studies wherein growth capacity correlates well with in vivo abundance. Further value of the underlying resource is demonstrated by correcting pathway gaps in available genome-scale metabolic models of gut microorganisms. Together, the media resource and the extracted knowledge on growth abilities widen experimental and computational access to the gut microbiota.","The authors have characterized the growth of 96 human gut bacteria on a range of defined media, providing valuable insights into their metabolic capabilities and unique media for future studies."

We established a link between Rg and ileal CD AIEC strain LF82 by showing that dual colonization of ex-germ-free (GF) IL10-/- mice potentiated colitis and cecal H2S production. Rg precultured mucus increased LF82 growth and H2S production, H2S supported in vitro Rg survival in minimal medium, and H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo (DDW 2023). Rg’s capsule contains glucose and has an enzyme that cleaves off sialic acid (Neu5Ac), one of the terminal carbohydrates of mucus. Because inflamed colons become microaerophilic to some extent, we focused on Rg-derived glucose and mucus-derived Neu5Ac to explore expression of LF82 molecular pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. HYPOTHESIS AIEC LF82 genes regulating growth, H2S production and virulence are differentially expressed with glucose or Neu5Ac substrates in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. METHODS LF82 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with Rg-/mucus-derived carbohydrates or gut-relevant sulfur substrates for 16 hours in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. LF82 RNA cultured with glucose or Neu5Ac medium in each condition was isolated for RNA sequencing. We compared aerobic vs. anaerobic results for each medium with |Log2FC| &amp;gt; 3.0 considered significant change. RESULTS Rg associated mucus carbohydrates and gut-relevant sulfur substrates variably enhanced LF82 growth. LF82 grew better in Neu5Ac than glucose in aerobic and vice versa in anaerobic conditions (Fig.1). Neu5Ac metabolism pathways involving nanE (N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase) and dnaA (chromosomal replication initiator), directly involved in cell replication, were overexpressed in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions in Neu5Ac medium. Additionally, expression of other Neu5Ac metabolic pathway genes, nanT (sialic transporter) and nanA (N-acetylneuraminate lyase) were slightly increased. Porin OmpC, a non-specific glucose transporter, and dnaA were more highly expressed in anaerobic than aerobic conditions in glucose medium (Table 1A). Moreover, LF82 genes involved in H2S production, biofilm formation and antimicrobial drug resistance were overexpressed in glucose vs. Neu5Ac with aerobic culture (Table 1B). CONCLUSIONS AIEC LF82 differentially uses R. gnavus released mucus components for growth in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions, and sialic acid and glucose activate distinct molecular pathways in the two conditions. Confirmatory functional experiments are underway. Glucose influences on LF82 H2S production and biofilm formation would provide strong evidence of cross-feeding between LF82 and R. gnavus, leading to potential diagnostic/treatment clues for further investigation.

Some gut bacteria utilize mucus as a nutrient source and can under certain conditions damage the protective barrier it forms, increasing disease susceptibility. We investigated how Ruminococcus torques— a known mucin degrader that has been implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)—degrades mucin glycoproteins or their component O -linked glycans to understand its effects on the availability of mucin-derived nutrients for other bacteria. We found that R. torques utilizes both mucin glycoproteins and released oligosaccharides from gastric and colonic mucins, degrading these substrates with a panoply of mostly constitutively expressed, secreted enzymes. Investigation of mucin oligosaccharide degradation by R. torques revealed strong α-L-fucosidase, sialidase and β1,4-galactosidase activities. There was a lack of detectable sulfatase and weak β1,3-galactosidase degradation, resulting in accumulation of glycans containing these structures on mucin polypeptides. While the Gram-negative symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron grows poorly on mucin glycoproteins, we demonstrate a clear ability of R. torques to liberate products from mucins, making them accessible to B. thetaiotaomicron . This work underscores the diversity of mucin-degrading mechanisms in different bacterial species and the probability that some species are contingent on others for the ability to more fully access mucin-derived nutrients. The ability of R. torques to directly degrade a variety of mucin and mucin glycan structures and unlock released glycans for other species suggests that it is a keystone mucin degrader, which might contribute to its association with IBD. IMPORTANCE An important facet of maintaining healthy symbiosis between host and intestinal microbes is the mucus layer, the first defense protecting the epithelium from lumenal bacteria. Some gut bacteria degrade the various components of intestinal mucins, but detailed mechanisms used by different species are still emerging. It is imperative to understand these mechanisms as they likely dictate interspecies interactions and may illuminate species associated with bacterial mucus damage and subsequent disease susceptibility. Ruminococcus torques is positively associated with IBD in multiple studies. We identified mucin glycan-degrading enzymes in R. torques and found that it shares mucin degradation products with another species of gut bacteria, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron . Our findings underscore the importance of understanding mucin degradation mechanisms in different gut bacteria and their consequences on interspecies interactions, which may identify keystone bacteria that disproportionately affect mucus damage and could therefore be key players in effects that result from reductions in mucus integrity.

The molecular cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the gut play an important role in the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis and general health. Here, we studied the impact of a major Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells.

Methods and Results
Our results showed that R. gnavus E1 specifically increases the expression and the glycosylation level of the intestinal glyco-conjugates by goblet cells in the colonic mucosa of mono-associated mice with R. gnavus E1 as well as in human HT29-MTX cells. Such an effect was mediated through induction of the level of mRNA encoding for the major intestinal gel-forming mucin such as MUC2 and various glycosyltransferase enzymes.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time that R. gnavus E1 possess the ability to modulate the glycosylation profile of the glyco-conjugate molecules and mucus in goblet cells.

Significance and Impact of the Study
Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. gnavus E1 modified specifically the glycosylation pattern and MUC2 expression by means of a small soluble factor of peptidic nature (<3 kDa) and heat stable in the HT29-MTX cell.","The impact of a major Gram‐positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus, is studied on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells."

Some gut bacteria are able to utilize mucin glycoproteins, the main mucus component, as a nutrient source. However, it remains unclear which bacterial enzymes initiate degradation of the complex O-glycans found in mucins. In the distal colon, these glycans are heavily sulfated, but specific sulfatases that are active on colonic mucins have not been identified.

We characterized the activity of 12 different sulfatases produced by this species, showing that they are collectively active on all known sulfate linkages in O-glycans. Crystal structures of three enzymes provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of substrate specificity. Unexpectedly, we found that a single sulfatase is essential for utilization of sulfated O-glycans in vitro and also has a major role in vivo.

Gut microbiota-mucosa-epithelial cells co-exist in an intricate three-way relationship that underpins gut homeostasis, and ultimately influences health and disease conditions. The O-glycans of mucin glycoproteins have been uncovered as a centrepiece of this system, although understanding the phenomena at play at the molecular level has been challenging and subject to significant traction over the last years. The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent advances in the phenomena that mediate microbiota and mucus multidirectional interactions in the human gut.


RECENT FINDINGS
The mucus biosynthesis and degradation by both commensal and pathogenic bacteria is under tight regulation and involves hundreds of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and transporters. The fucosylation of O-glycans from mucin-2 seems to dictate binding by pathogenic species and to influence their virulence. Less clear is the influence of O-glycans in quorum sensing and biofilm formation. We have reviewed the advances in the in vitro models available to recreate the phenomena that capture the physiological context of the intestinal environment, emphasising models that include mucus and other aspects relevant to the physiological context.


SUMMARY
The recent findings highlight the importance of merging advances in analytical (glycans analysis) and omics techniques along with original robust in vitro models that enable to deconstruct part of the high complexity of the living gut and expand our understanding of the microbes-mucosa relationships and their significance in health and disease.","The recent findings highlight the importance of merging advances in analytical (glycans analysis) and omics techniques along with original robust in vitro models that enable to deconstruct part of the high complexity of the living gut and expand the understanding of the microbes-mucosa relationships and their significance in health and disease."

In the colon, secreted mucus creates a physical barrier that separates these microbes from the intestinal epithelium. Some gut bacteria are able to utilize mucin glycoproteins, the main mucus component, as a nutrient source. However, it remains unclear which bacterial enzymes initiate the degradation of the highly complex O -glycans found in mucins. In the colon, these glycans are heavily sulfated, but the specific sulfatases that are active on colonic mucins have not been identified. Here, we show that sulfatases are essential to the utilization of colonic mucin O -glycans by the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron . We have characterized the activity of 12 different sulfatases encoded by this species, showing that these enzymes collectively are active on all of the known sulfate linkages in colonic O -glycans. Crystal structures of 3 enzymes provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of substrate-specificity. Unexpectedly, we found that a single sulfatase is essential for utilization of sulfated O -glycans in vitro and also plays a major role in vivo . Our results provide insight into the mechanisms of mucin degradation by gut bacteria, an important process for both normal microbial gut colonization and diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Sulfatase activity is likely to be a keystone step in bacterial mucin degradation and inhibition of these enzymes may therefore represent a viable therapeutic path for treatment of IBD and other diseases.","It is found that a single sulfatase is essential for utilization of sulfated O-glycans in vitro and also plays a major role in vivo, providing insight into the mechanisms of mucin degradation by gut bacteria."

The review starts by setting up the biological context underpinning the need for experimental models to study gut bacteria-mucus interactions in the digestive environment. We provide an overview of the structure and function of intestinal mucus and mucins, their interactions with intestinal bacteria (including commensal, probiotics and pathogenic microorganisms) and their role in modulating health and disease states.

Various gut microbial species possess diverse hydrolytic enzymes and catabolic pathways for breaking down mucin glycans, resulting in competition for the limited nutrients within the gut environment. Adherence to mucin glycans represents a crucial strategy used by gut microbes to access nutrient reservoirs. Understanding these properties is pivotal for comprehending the survival mechanisms of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. However, characterization of individual strains within the vast array of coexisting bacteria in the microbiome is challenging. To investigate this, we developed mucin-immobilized particles by immobilizing porcine gastric mucin (PGM) onto glass beads chemically modified with boronic acid. These PGM-immobilized particles were then anaerobically cultured with human fecal microbiota, and the bacteria adhering to PGM were isolated. Interestingly, the microbiome composition remained largely unchanged irrespective of PGM immobilization. Nonetheless, bacteria isolated from PGM-immobilized glass particles exhibited notably higher N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity compared to the control beads. Furthermore, Bacteroides strains isolated from PGM-immobilized glass particles displayed enhanced adhesive and metabolic properties to PGM. These findings underscore the utility of PGM particles in enriching and isolating specific microbes. Moreover, they highlight substantial differences in microbial properties at the strain level. We anticipate that PGM-immobilized particles will advance culture-based microbiome research, emphasizing the significance of strain-level characterization.


IMPORTANCE
Metabolism of mucin glycans by gut bacteria represents a crucial strategy for accessing nutrient reservoirs. The efficacy of mucin glycan utilization among gut bacteria hinges on the metabolic capabilities of individual strains, necessitating meticulous strain-level characterization. In this investigation, we used glass beads chemically immobilized with mucins to selectively enrich bacteria from fecal fermentation cultures, based on their superior adhesion to and metabolism of mucin glycoproteins. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that the physical interactions between bacteria and mucin glycoprotein components directly correlate with their capacity to utilize mucins as nutrient sources. Furthermore, our study implies that physical proximity may significantly influence bacterial nutrient acquisition within the ecosystem, facilitating gut bacteria's access to carbohydrate components.","Researchers developed mucin-immobilized particles to study gut microbiome diversity, finding that specific bacteria strains exhibit enhanced adhesive and metabolic properties to mucin, highlighting the importance of strain-level characterization in understanding gut bacteria's nutrient acquisition strategies."

Most of the polysaccharides that reach the colon are plant cell wall polysaccharides, but some starch may also reach the colon (Englyst and Cummings, 1985). Plant polysaccharides are extensively degraded during passage through the colon and probably provide a major part of the carbon and energy required by colonic bacteria (Van Soest, 1978). Dietary polysaccharides are not the only type of carbohydrate that enters the colon. Goblet cells in the mucosa produce copious amounts of glycoprotein mucin, and the constant sloughing of cells from the mucosa of the small and large intestine releases tissue mucopolysaccharides into the lumen (Lennarz, 1980). Mucopolysaccharides are also found in meat.","Dietary polysaccharides in the human diet that are not digested and absorbed in the stomach and small intestine enter the colon, where they are available for fermention by the complex and numerous population of bacteria that resides there."

Bacteria colonizing the mucus layer have evolved to use mucin as a carbon and energy source. One of the members of the mucosa-associated microbiota is Akkermansia muciniphila, which is capable of producing an extensive repertoire of mucin-degrading enzymes. To further study the substrate utilization abilities of A. muciniphila, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model to test amino acid auxotrophy, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar-degrading capacities. The model-supported predictions were validated by in vitro experiments, which showed A. muciniphila to be able to utilize the mucin-derived monosaccharides fucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Growth was also observed on N-acetylgalactosamine, even though the metabolic model did not predict this. The uptake of these sugars, as well as the nonmucin sugar glucose, was enhanced in the presence of mucin, indicating that additional mucin-derived components are needed for optimal growth. An analysis of whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) comparing the gene expression of A. muciniphila grown on mucin with that of the same bacterium grown on glucose confirmed the activity of the genes involved in mucin degradation and revealed most of these to be upregulated in the presence of mucin. The transcriptional response was confirmed by a proteome analysis, altogether revealing a hierarchy in the use of sugars and reflecting the adaptation of A. muciniphila to the mucosal environment. In conclusion, these findings provide molecular insights into the lifestyle of A. muciniphila and further confirm its role as a mucin specialist in the gut.IMPORTANCEAkkermansia muciniphila is among the most abundant mucosal bacteria in humans and in a wide range of other animals. Recently, A. muciniphila has attracted considerable attention because of its capacity to protect against diet-induced obesity in mouse models.

Hence, we constructed a genome-scale model and describe its validation by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches on bacterial cells grown on mucus and glucose, a nonmucus sugar. The results provide detailed molecular insight into the mucus-degrading lifestyle of A. muciniphila and further confirm the role of this mucin specialist in producing propionate and acetate under conditions of the intestinal tract.","A genome-scale metabolic model is constructed and its validation by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches on bacterial cells grown on mucus and glucose, a nonmucus sugar provides detailed molecular insight into the mucus-degrading lifestyle of A. muciniphila and confirms its role as a mucin specialist in the gut."

Its disruption is a hallmark of gastrointestinal diseases like ulcerative colitis. While glycan foraging by gut bacteria is thought to initiate mucus disruption, its impact on mucus structural properties remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. To address this gap, we developed a method to collect human-cell-derived mucus that closely mimics the mechanical properties of human colonic mucus. Using this system, we investigated mucus utilization and degradation by a panel of commensal bacteria with distinct metabolic profiles. Glycan utilization by species such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides fragilis showed no correlation with changes in mucus rheology. Instead, secreted proteases were identified as the primary driver of mucus degradation. Protease activity by B. fragilis and Bifidobacterium longum was influenced by nutrient availability, whereas in Enterococcus faecalis, it was additionally affected by oxygen exposure. E. faecalis also adapted to oxidative stress by enhancing carbohydrate metabolism and upregulating several virulence genes. Together, our findings reveal that bacterial mucus degradation is context-dependent and shaped by environmental factors. This study provides key insights into the mechanisms underlying mucus degradation and underscores the value of human cell-derived mucus models for understanding bacteria-mucus interactions in health and disease.

In the CF lung, however, P. aeruginosa may access preferred carbon sources (e.g., amino acids and short-chain fatty acids) through metabolic cross-feeding with co-colonizing mucin-degrading microbes. Although host-derived enzymes such as neutrophil elastase can also degrade mucins, the extent to which host-mediated mucin breakdown supports P. aeruginosa growth remains unclear. Thus, here we compared the nutritional impact of microbial versus host mucolytic activity on P. aeruginosa physiology. Analyses of CF sputum revealed patient-specific variability in mucin integrity that is shaped by both host and microbial factors. We demonstrate that mucin degradation by anaerobic bacteria through proteolysis, glycolysis, and fermentation, promotes robust P. aeruginosa growth, unlike mucin processed by neutrophil elastase alone. Targeted metabolomics identified acetate and propionate as key metabolites driving this cross-feeding, while transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses revealed that P. aeruginosa engages in diauxic growth on a broader set of mucin-derived substrates. Unexpectedly, cross-feeding with anaerobes triggered the induction of P. aeruginosa denitrification and fermentation pathways, suggesting redox remodeling despite being cultured under oxygen-replete conditions. Finally, the transcriptional profile of P. aeruginosa grown on anaerobe-conditioned mucins more closely resembled its in vivo gene expression, more so than when grown on intact or neutrophil-degraded mucins. Together, these findings provide new insight into the potential role of interspecies metabolic interactions in shaping pathogen physiology in the inflammatory, polymicrobial, and mucus-rich environment of the CF airways. Author Summary Cystic fibrosis (CF) airways contain viscous mucus that traps both pathogens and commensals. The major pathogen, P. aeruginosa thrives in these mucus-rich, inflamed environments, but how it acquires nutrients to sustain growth is poorly understood. We demonstrate that while host neutrophil enzymes degrade mucin polymers, this degradation alone does not provide substantial nutrients to support P. aeruginosa proliferation. In contrast, co-colonizing anaerobic microbiota extensively degrade mucins and generate short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites that strongly promote P. aeruginosa growth. We show that anaerobe-degraded mucins not only support faster growth but also trigger redox remodeling and gene expression changes that closely resemble P. aeruginosa behavior in CF patient sputum. This work highlights the important role of interspecies metabolic interactions in shaping CF airway infections and suggests new consideration for therapeutic strategies targeting airway microbiomes. ","Host- and microbial-mediated mucin degradation differentially impacts Pseudomonas aeruginosa physiology, with anaerobic bacteria-driven mucin breakdown promoting robust growth, redox remodeling, and gene expression changes, contrasting with neutrophil elastase-mediated degradation."

In recent years, a dozen carbohydrate-active enzymes from cultivated mucin degraders have been characterized. But yet, considering the fact that uncultured species predominate in the human gut microbiota, these biochemical data are far from exhaustive. In this study, we used functional metagenomics to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans. First, we performed a high-throughput screening of a fosmid metagenomic library constructed from the ileum mucosa microbiota using chromogenic substrates. The screening resulted in the isolation of 124 clones producing activities crucial in the degradation of human O- and N-glycans, namely sialidases, β-D-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, β-D-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase, and/or β-D-mannosidase. Thirteen of these clones were selected based on their diversified functional profiles and were further analyzed on a secondary screening. This step consisted of lectin binding assays to demonstrate the ability of the clones to degrade human intestinal mucus. In total, the structural modification of several mucin motifs, sialylated mucin ones in particular, was evidenced for nine clones. Sequencing their metagenomic loci highlighted complex catabolic pathways involving the complementary functions of glycan sensing, transport, hydrolysis, deacetylation, and deamination, which were sometimes associated with amino acid metabolism machinery. These loci are assigned to several Bacteroides and Feacalibacterium species highly prevalent and abundant in the gut microbiome and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans.","Functional metagenomics is used to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans."

Like microorganisms adapted to other complex nutrient environments, gut symbionts give different metabolic priorities to substrates present in mixtures. We investigated the responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common human intestinal bacterium that metabolizes more than a dozen different polysaccharides, including the O-linked glycans that are abundant in secreted mucin. Experiments in which mucin glycans were presented simultaneously with other carbohydrates show that degradation of these host carbohydrates is consistently repressed in the presence of alternative substrates, even by B. thetaiotaomicron previously acclimated to growth in pure mucin glycans. Experiments with media containing systematically varied carbohydrate cues and genetic mutants reveal that transcriptional repression of genes involved in mucin glycan metabolism is imposed by simple sugars and, in one example that was tested, is mediated through a small intergenic region in a transcript-autonomous fashion. Repression of mucin glycan-responsive gene clusters in two other human gut bacteria, Bacteroides massiliensis and Bacteroides fragilis, exhibited variable and sometimes reciprocal responses compared to those of B. thetaiotaomicron, revealing that these symbionts vary in their preference for mucin glycans and that these differences occur at the level of controlling individual gene clusters. Our results reveal that sensing and metabolic triaging of glycans are complex processes that vary among species, underscoring the idea that these phenomena are likely to be hidden drivers of microbiota community dynamics and may dictate which microorganisms preferentially commit to various niches in a constantly changing nutritional environment. IMPORTANCE Human intestinal microorganisms impact many aspects of health and disease, including digestion and the propensity to develop disorders such as inflammation and colon cancer. Complex carbohydrates are a major component of the intestinal habitat, and numerous species have evolved and refined strategies to compete for these coveted nutrients. Our findings reveal that individual bacteria exhibit different preferences for carbohydrates emanating from host diet and mucosal secretions and that some of these prioritization strategies are opposite to one another. Thus, we reveal new aspects of how individual bacteria, some with otherwise similar metabolic potential, partition to “preferred niches” in the complex gut ecosystem, which has important and immediate implications for understanding and predicting the behavioral dynamics of this community.","Investigating the responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common human intestinal bacterium that metabolizes more than a dozen different polysaccharides, reveals new aspects of how individual bacteria partition to “preferred niches” in the complex gut ecosystem, which has important and immediate implications for understanding and predicting the behavioral dynamics of this community."

Characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon and repeated bouts of diarrhea, ICD is largely unresponsive to medical interventions, including corticosteroid, antiparasitic, and antibiotic treatments. Although ICD is accompanied by large disruptions in the composition of the commensal gut microbiome, no single pathogen has been concretely identified as responsible for the onset and continuation of the disease. Fecal samples were collected from 12 ICD-diagnosed macaques and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. RNA was extracted for metatranscriptomic analysis of organisms and functional annotations associated with the gut microbiome. Bacterial, fungal, archaeal, protozoan, and macaque (host) transcripts were simultaneously assessed. ICD-afflicted animals were characterized by increased expression of host-derived genes involved in inflammation and increased transcripts from bacterial pathogens such as Campylobacter and Helicobacter and the protozoan Trichomonas.

The thick mucus layer that lines the inner surface of the large intestine is rich in sugars that can serve as nutrient sources for several members of the microbiota. Whether these sugars can also be used by invading bacterial pathogens to colonize the GI tract is still unclear, in particular for the family of attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens, including the human diarrheal pathogens EHEC and EPEC. Aims To investigate the ability of the murine A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium to use mucin-derived sugars as a nutrient source, and the importance of these sugars in the virulence of C. rodentium during in-vivo infection. Methods To identify which sugar(s) are required for C. rodentium to colonize and grow in the murine GI tract, we generated mutants lacking single or multiple genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of mucin-derived O-glycan sugars. This was followed by in-vitro growth assays in minimal media supplemented with mucin sugars to investigate the growth properties of C. rodentium and the generated mutants on mucin sugars. Results We determined that C. rodentium was able to use three mucin O-glycan sugars: sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as both carbon and nitrogen sources for in-vitro growth. C. rodentium exhibited the maximal growth rate and density on GlcNAc, followed by sialic acid, and finally galactose. A mutant C. rodentium strain carrying a deletion in the nagA gene was unable to grow on both GlcNAc and sialic acid, confirming that the breakdown pathways for these two sugars merge and are processed by shared suite of enzymes. As for galactose, combined deletions in the genes mglB and galP were required to abolish growth on this sugar. Notably, a mutant strain carrying simultaneous deletions in nagA, mglB, and galP was unable to grow on all three mucin sugars, as well as on purified mucin. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that intestinal mucin sugars serve as potential nutrient sources for C. rodentium and that C. rodentium can catabolize three of these sugars. Future work will examine whether these sugar pathways contribute to C. rodentium colonization of the murine GI tract. Funding Agencies CCC, CIHRCH.I.L.D.

We examined how the breakdown of prebiotic dietary fibers by the gut microbiome affects mucin secretion by intestinal epithelial cells. Metagenomic analyses of in vitro gut microbiome consortia revealed taxonomic profiles and genetic diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes that digest polysaccharides. Two independent consortia exhibited different abilities to produce acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid via the fermentation of polysaccharides derived from dietary fibers of grains and mushrooms. Although acetic acid generally had the highest concentration, the ratios of butyric acid and propionic acid to acetic acid varied depending on the polysaccharide source. These short-chain fatty acids affected morphological differentiation and mucin secretion in HT-29 human intestinal epithelial cells. These results suggest that prebiotic dietary fibers can be digested and metabolized by the gut microbiome to short-chain fatty acids, which can affect gut epithelial cells both directly and indirectly via the modulation of the gut microbiota and their enzymes.

To date, diverse isotopically labeled substrates have been used to characterize in situ growth activity of specific bacterial taxa and have revealed the flux of bioavailable substrates through microbial communities associated with health and disease. A major limitation to the growth of the field is the dearth of biologically relevant ""heavy"" labeled substrates. Mucin glycoproteins, for example, comprise an abundant source of carbon in the gut, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and other mucosal surfaces but are not commercially available. Here, we describe a method to incorporate a 13C-labeled monosaccharide into MUC5AC, a predominant mucin in both gastrointestinal and airway environments. Using the lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3, polarized cell cultures grown in 13C-labeled d-glucose resulted in liberal mucin production on the apical surface. Mucins were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography, and O-linked glycans were released by β-elimination, permethylated, and analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) techniques. We demonstrate a 98.7% incorporation of 13C in the heterogeneous O-linked oligosaccharides that make up >80% of mucin dry weight. These ""heavy"" labeled glycoproteins represent a valuable tool for probing in vivo activity of host-associated bacterial communities and their interactions with the mucosal barrier. The continued expansion of labeled substrates for use in SIP will eventually allow bacterial taxa that degrade host compounds to be identified, with long-term potential for improved health and disease management.","A method to incorporate a 13C-labeled monosaccharide into MUC5AC, a predominant mucin in both gastrointestinal and airway environments, is described, demonstrating a 98.7% incorporation of 13C in the heterogeneous O-linked oligosACcharides that make up >80% of mucin dry weight."

A. muciniphila has been correlated with human health in previous studies, but a mechanistic explanation is lacking. In this study, the main site of colonisation was characterised alongside additional conditions, such as differences in colon pH, prebiotic supplementation and variable mucin supply.

In this model, A. muciniphila was found to colonise the distal colon compartment more abundantly than the proximal colon ((±8 log copies/ml compared to ±4 log copies/ml) and the preference for the distal compartment was found to be pH-dependent. The addition of mucin caused a specific increase of A. muciniphila (±4.5 log increase over two days), far exceeding the response of other bacteria present, together with an increase in propionate.

As a commonly used food ingredient, we explored whether ovomucin has an effect on the gut microbiota. O- Glycan analysis revealed that ovomucin contained core-1 and 2 structures with heavy modification by N -acetylneuraminic acid and/or sulfate groups. Of the two mucin-degrading gut microbes we tested, Akkermansia muciniphila grew in medium containing ovomucin as a sole carbon source during a 24 h culture period, whereas Bifidobacterium bifidum did not. Both gut microbes, however, degraded ovomucin O -glycans and released monosaccharides into the culture supernatants in a species-dependent manner, as revealed by semi-quantified mass spectrometric analysis and anion exchange chromatography analysis. Our data suggest that ovomucin potentially affects the gut microbiota through O -glycan decomposition by gut microbes and degradant sugar sharing within the community.","The data suggest that ovomucin potentially affects the gut microbiota through O -glycan decomposition by gut microbes and degradant sugar sharing within the community."

Mucins are complex glycoproteins that contain heavily sulfated O-glycans and form the protective colonic mucus layer. Bacterial carbohydrate sulfatases are required to metabolise these heavily sulfated mucin glycans and excessive bacterial foraging has been associated with several diseases. Sulfatases have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease, making these microbiota enzymes potential drug targets. A. muciniphila expresses carbohydrate sulfatases that can act on colonic mucins yet their roles in its metabolism remain opaque. Our data reveal that A. muciniphila requires glycopeptides/protein forms of colonic mucin for metabolism and its sulfatases have unique adaptations compared to Bacteroides species. Localisation studies reveal that desulfation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, but not D-galactose, is exclusively periplasmic. A cell surface sulfatase has a novel carbohydrate binding module that binds to colonic mucin. This paints a contrasting picture of sulfated mucin metabolism by Akkermansia muciniphila versus Bacteroides species. These data will be important for understanding the contexts for Akkermansia muciniphilas positive health correlations. ","Akkermansia muciniphila, a beneficial gut bacterium, utilizes colonic mucin through sulfatases, which have unique adaptations and binding mechanisms, contrasting with Bacteroides species, and are potential targets for inflammatory bowel disease treatment."

Its disruption is a hallmark of diseases like ulcerative colitis, yet how bacterial activity impacts mucus structure remains unclear. We developed a method to collect human-cell-derived mucus that mimics human colonic mucus and used it to investigate mucus degradation by commensal bacteria. Glycan foraging by species such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides fragilis did not alter mucus rheology. Instead, secreted proteases were the primary drivers of degradation. Protease activity by B. fragilis and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis was nutrient-dependent, while Enterococcus faecalis was further influenced by oxygen. Under oxidative stress, E. faecalis upregulated carbohydrate metabolism and virulence genes. These results reveal that bacterial mucus degradation is context-dependent and shaped by environmental factors. Our findings underscore the value of human cell-derived mucus models for understanding bacteria-mucus interactions in health and disease.

"Cross-feeding interactions of gut symbionts driven by human milk oligosaccharidesand mucins","https://scispace.com/paper/cross-feeding-interactions-of-gut-symbionts-driven-by-human-2mbndfw0ud","2018","Dissertation","","Loo Wee Chia","10.18174/444432","https://scispace.com/pdf/cross-feeding-interactions-of-gut-symbionts-driven-by-human-2mbndfw0ud.pdf","The co-evolution of the human host and the gut microbiota has led to bacterial adaption to forage on host-produced glycans such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) and mucins. In early life, the HMOS that are present in mother milk contribute to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota. Furthermore, mucins that cover the intestinal lining create a stable niche for bacterial colonization throughout a person’s life. Due to the highly complex nature of these host-secreted glycans, bacteria equipped with specific glycan-degrading enzymes can exploit them as substrate for growth. Subsequently, the glycan-degrading bacteria can drive microbial networks via cross-feeding. The glycan-foraging microbial population exerts a large influence on the host physiology, by influencing the immune, metabolic, and neurological development early in life, and by conferring colonisation resistance throughout life. The work described in this thesis aims to improve our understanding of the metabolic dependencies between the milk- and mucin-degrading microbes (Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and butyrate-producing bacteria (Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). Bacteria-derived butyrate is the preferred energy source for host epithelial cells and is associated with a range of beneficial effects including enhancement of colonic barrier function, increased satiety, and protection against inflammation, and cancer. In the introductory chapter, the role of human milk and mucin glycans in fostering the gut microbial network is discussed. As such, the molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented. In Chapter 2 and 3, the role of HMOS as selective substrates for microbial growth that drive the establishment of the infant gut microbiota was investigated. At this developmental stage, HMOS promote the dominance of bifidobacteria from the Actinobacteria phylum. Upon weaning, the gut microbiota shifts towards an adult gut microbiota composition that is predominantly comprised of bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. In chapter 2, the interaction between a HMOS-degrader, Bifidobacterium infantis (Actinobacteria phylum) and a butyrogenic non-HMOS-degrader, Anaerostipes caccae (a member of the Lachnospiraceae from the Firmicutes phylum) was studied. Anaerostipes caccae in monoculture was not able to metabolise lactose or HMOS but its growth and concomitant butyrate production were detected in co-cultures with Bifidobacterium infantis. Anaerostipes caccae was sustained by cross-feeding on the monosaccharides, lactate and acetate derived from Bifidobacterium infantis. Bifidobacterium infantis fully degraded lactose and the complete range of low molecular weight HMOS, pointing towards the key ecological role of bifidobacteria in providing substrates for other important emerging species in the infant gut. The gradual shift of the microbiota composition in the ecosystem contributing to the slow induction of butyrate could also be important for gut maturation. In chapter 3, the microbial network formation in the infant gut driven by another HMOS-degrading species, namely Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was studied. We showed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could metabolise lactose and HMOS. The bacterium showed different preference for specific HMOS structures when grown in co-culture. Subsequently, Anaerostipes caccae cross-fed on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-derived monosaccharides, lactate and acetate for growth and butyrate production. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron might drive the establishment of the microbial network in the infant gut, leading to the sequential establishment of adult-like functional groups such as lactate-utilising and butyrate-producing bacteria. Furthermore, we observed stereospecific lactate isomer production in which Bacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. produced predominantly D- and L-lactate, respectively. The distinct lactate isomer production by these major glycans-degrading genera might affect the gut microbiota compositions by differential cross-feeding interaction with the lactate-utilisers. Chapter 4 and 5 studied the role of mucins in creating a micro-environment that leads to the formation of a microbial network at the intestinal mucosal layer. In chapter 4, we demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut symbiont specialised in mucin degradation, could support the growth of the butyrate-producing cross-feeders Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Akkermansia muciniphila metabolised the complex mucin glycans into short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and 1,2-propanediol as well as the mucin-derived sugars. Subsequently, acetate and the liberated sugars could be used by the butyrate-producers for growth and concomitant butyrate production. Interestingly, a bidirectional cross-feeding was observed between Akkermansia muciniphila and Eubacterium hallii. Pseudo-vitamin B12 produced by Eubacterium hallii facilitated propionate production by Akkermansia muciniphila via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Propionate could be beneficial to the human host by regulating satiety and lipid biosynthesis in the liver, indicative of a mutualistic host-microbial interaction driven by mucin glycans. In chapter 5, we studied the molecular mechanism of cross-feeding between Akkermansia muciniphila and Anaerostipes caccae by metatranscriptomics. We observed a differential transcriptional response of Akkermansia muciniphila grown in monoculture as compared to a co-culture together with Anaerostipes caccae. In particular, the expression of the extracellular mucin-degrading enzymes by Akkermansia muciniphila was heightened in co-cultures. As a result, the monosaccharides liberated from the breakdown of mucin oligosaccharides chain could support the central metabolism of both Akkermansia muciniphila and the butyrate-producer. This suggested that Akkermansia muciniphila plays a key role in supporting the microbial community at the mucosal environment of the intestine by increasing the availability of substrates. In summary, this thesis demonstrated the key functional role of milk- and mucin-degrading symbionts in fostering a butyrogenic microbial network via cross-feeding. Ecologically, HMOS-degraders are critical to drive the establishment of a healthy infant gut microbiota, whilst mucin-degraders are vital to maintain a beneficial mucosal community. A better understanding of the complex nature of both the microbial network and the host-secreted glycans could aid in the design of nutritional intervention for health improvement. To this end, innovative avenues using novel probiotic strains (key species including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and butyrate-producing Clostridium), prebiotics (HMOS in early nutrition) and microbiota-targeted nutrients (iron and vitamin B12) deem promising.","The molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented and it is shown that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae."

Mucins from tissues with unique glycosylation differentially tuned microbial composition, as did isolated mucin glycan libraries, uncovering the importance of specific glycan patterns in microbiome modulation. We found that mucins shape microbial communities in several ways: serving as nutrients to support metabolic diversity, organizing spatial structure through reduced aggregation, and possibly limiting antagonism between competing taxa. Overall, this work identifies mucin glycans as a natural host mechanism and potential therapeutic intervention to maintain healthy microbial communities.

Central to their survival is the ability to metabolise complex dietary and host-derived glycans including intestinal mucins. The latter are critical components of the gut epithelium glycocalyx and mucus barriers, essential for microbiota-gut homeostasis and protection from infections by pathogens. The prominent and model human gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) is a versatile and highly efficient complex glycan degrader thanks to the expansion of gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilisation loci (PULs) in its genome. While the mechanisms for several singular dietary glycan-induced PULs have been elucidated, studies on the 16-18 mucin-induced PULs in B. theta significantly lag behind. A combination of the scale and complexity of B. theta transcriptomic response to mucins and complex glycan configurations of mucins represent major hurdles for the functional characterisation of the mucin induced PULs. As a result, there is very limited knowledge on how mucin metabolism is coordinated in B. theta and what specific PULs, genes and metabolites are critical for mucin-B. theta, and more generally mucin-microbiota interactions and their importance in microbiota-gut homeostasis. Here we show that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50, (i) encodes activities consistent with a machinery that couples the processing of mucin-O glycan glycoproteins with the metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), an abundant mucin O-glycan sugar; (ii) is important for competitive growth on mucins in-vitro; (iii) encodes a key kinase enzyme (BT4240) that is critical for GalNAc metabolism and (iv) has related PULs encoded by a range of prominent Bacteroides species in the human gut. Furthermore, BT4240 kinase was also critical for glycosaminoglycan metabolism, thus extending the PULs function beyond mucins. Our work advances our understanding of the vital metabolic processes that govern mucosal glycoprotein metabolism and by implication, a key aspect of host-microbiota interactions at mucosal surfaces and highlight GalNAc as a key metabolite targeted for competitive growth.","This work shows that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50 encodes activities consistent with a machinery that couples the processing of mucin-O glycan glycoproteins with the metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), an abundant mucin O-glycan sugar that is important for competitive growth on mucins in-vitro."
