The constant flux of host-secreted mucin at the mucosal layer creates a steady niche for bacterial colonization. Mucin degradation by keystone species subsequently shapes the microbial community. This study investigated the transcriptional response during mucin-driven trophic interaction between the specialised mucin-degrader Akkermansia muciniphila and a butyrogenic gut commensal Anaerostipes caccae. A. muciniphila monocultures and co-cultures with non-mucolytic A. caccae from the Lachnospiraceae family were grown anaerobically in minimal media supplemented with mucin. We analysed for growth, metabolites (HPLC analysis), microbial composition (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), and transcriptional response (RNA-seq). Mucin degradation by A. muciniphila supported the growth of A. caccae and concomitant butyrate production predominantly via the acetyl-CoA pathway. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) showed the presence of A. caccae induced changes in the A. muciniphila transcriptional response with increased expression of mucin degradation genes and reduced expression of ribosomal genes. Two putative operons that encode for uncharacterised proteins and an efflux system, and several two-component systems were also differentially regulated. This indicated A. muciniphila changed its transcriptional regulation in response to A. caccae. This study provides insight to understand the mucin-driven microbial ecology using metatranscriptomics. Our findings show that the expression of mucolytic enzymes by A. muciniphila increases upon the presence of a community member. This could indicate its role as a keystone species that supports the microbial community in the mucosal environment by increasing the availability of mucin sugars.","Findings show that the expression of mucolytic enzymes by A. muciniphila increases upon the presence of a community member, which could indicate its role as a keystone species that supports the microbial community in the mucosal environment by increasing the availability of mucin sugars."

Andre G. Buret","10.1152/ajpgi.00261.2022","","Mucin O-linked glycans are important mediators of host-microbiota-pathogen interactions in the gastrointestinal tract. The major component of intestinal mucus, the MUC2 mucin, is densely glycosylated, with up to 80% of its weight/volume ratio represented by O-linked glycans. Glycosylation of secretory gel-forming mucins has an enormous impact on intestinal barrier function, microbial metabolism, and mucus colonization by both pathogenic and commensal microbes. Mucin O-glycans and glycan-derived sugars may be degraded and utilized as a nutrient source, and may regulate microbial gene expression and virulence. Short chain fatty acids, produced as a by-product of glycan fermentation, can regulate host immunity and goblet cell activity, and are important for host-microbe homeostasis. Mucin glycans may also act as microbial binding sites, influencing intestinal colonization and translocation through the mucus gel barrier. Recent findings indicate that alterations to mucin glycosylation impact the susceptibility of mucins to degradation, resulting in altered barrier function and intestinal permeability. Alterations to mucin glycosylation patterns are frequently observed during intestinal infection and inflammation, and have been implicated in microbiota dysbiosis and expansion of pathobionts. Recent work has demonstrated that these alterations can play key roles in disease pathogenesis. The precise mechanisms remain obscure. This review highlights the important roles of O-linked glycans in host-microbe interactions and disease pathogenesis in the context of intestinal infections.","A review of the role of O-linked glycans in host-microbe interactions and disease pathogenesis in the context of intestinal infections is presented in this paper , where the authors highlight the important roles of o-linked glycans and glycan-derived sugars."

The mucus layer covering the gastrointestinal tract is the primary interface between the intestinal tissue and the commensal bacteria that colonize the host or pathogenic organisms that attempt to infect the host. Mucins are the main structural components of mucus and mucin glycans provide bacterial ligands and a source of nutrients. Mucin glycosylation, therefore, plays a critical role in the modulation of host–microbial interactions in health and disease. Mucin glycosylation is very responsive to the immediate environment and varies depending on species, location in the body, hormonal status, inflammation, and the presence of microbes. Therefore, alterations in mucin glycosylation and mucus-associated microbiota are hallmarks of diseases characterized by a compromised mucosal barrier such as inflammatory bowel diseases or colon cancer. This chapter will focus on the symbiotic relationship between the gut microbiota and mucus with an emphasis on intestinal mucin glycosylation.

In this Review, we describe the components of the secreted and cell surface mucosal barriers and the evidence that they form an effective barricade against potential pathogens. However, successful enteric pathogens have evolved strategies to circumvent these barriers. We discuss the interactions between enteric pathogens and mucins, and the mechanisms that these pathogens use to disrupt and avoid mucosal barriers. In addition, we describe dynamic alterations in the mucin barrier that are driven by host innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.","The components of the secreted and cell surface mucosal barriers and the evidence that they form an effective barricade against potential pathogens are described and dynamic alterations in the mucin barrier are described driven by host innate and adaptive immune responses to infection."

Heavily glycosylated mucin not only establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens, but also serves as a niche for microbial growth. We hypothesized that dysbiosis may cause abnormal mucin utilization and microbial metabolic dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and mucin components in the stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients from Japan. The levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in the stools of both the CD and UC patients than in those of the healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified 7 bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels, among which the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans act as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgt+Treg cells and IgA-producing cells in the colonic lamina propria. Importantly, the availability of mucin-associated O-glycans to the microbiota was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients. Taken together, our findings highlight the biological significance of the symbiosynthesis pathway in the production of n-butyrate, which maintains gut immune homeostasis.","The findings highlight the biological significance of the symbiosynthesis pathway in the production of n-butyrate, which maintains gut immune homeostasis, and the availability of mucin-associated O-glycans to the microbiota was significantly reduced in n- butyrate-deficient UC patients."

Most of these microbial residents will grow within the mucus layer that overlies the gut epithelium and will act as the first line of defense against both commensal and invading microbes. This mucus is essentially formed by mucins, a family of highly glycosylated protein that are secreted by specialize cells in the gut. In this Review, we examine how commensal members of the microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use mucus to their advantage to promote their growth, develop biofilms and colonize the intestine. We also discuss how mucus-derived components act as nutrient and chemical cues for adaptation and pathogenesis of bacteria and how bacteria can influence the composition of the mucus layer.","This Review examines how commensal members of the microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use mucus to their advantage to promote their growth, develop biofilms and colonize the intestine and how mucus-derived components act as nutrient and chemical cues for adaptation and pathogenesis of bacteria."

Yet the key ecological properties of mucus resident communities that make them crucial for maintaining homeostatic microbiome function remain poorly defined. Using an approach that combines in situ hybridization, laser microdissection and 16s rRNA sequencing of spatially distinct regions of the mouse gut lumen, we discovered that the microbial community embedded in the mucus layer is structurally and compositionally distinct and drives stability of the gut microbiome. Structurally, the mucus residing microbial community had a higher density of bacteria than in the lumen and formed a biofilm-like structure whose integrity was dependent on Gram-positive commensals. Compositionally the dense mucus community excluded bacteria belonging to phylum Proteobacteria. Additionally, the dense bacterial community in the mucus was significantly more diverse and consisted of bacterial species that were unique to it. Upon antibiotic treatment, the species-rich and dense bacterial community in the mucus lost fewer Firmicutes and showed smaller bloom of Proteobacteria compared to the lumen. Taken together our work discloses a crucial role for the mucus layer in promoting stability of the gut microbiome in the perfused intestinal ecosystem by spatially entrenching unique and diverse bacterial species.","A crucial role for the mucus layer is discloses in promoting stability of the gut microbiome in the perfused intestinal ecosystem by spatially entrenching unique and diverse bacterial species."

Here, we used human colonic organoids derived from either a healthy tissue (wild-type) or ATOH1-knockout lines lacking goblet cell differentiation. Co-culturing wild-type or ATOH1-knockout organoids with A. muciniphila followed by RNA-sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional profiles modulated by mucin availability, particularly affecting genes for growth and stress resistance. Notably, mucin degradation genes exhibited limited responses, contrasting with studies using porcine mucin, highlighting the specificity of human mucin interactions. Conversely, genes for mucin uptake and pili formation (e.g., Amuc_1100), which are crucial for host interaction, were upregulated with wild-type organoids. These results underscore the importance of using physiologically relevant human models. Our findings reveal A. muciniphila’s adaptive gene regulation in response to human mucin, offering insights into host-microbe interactions shaped by the mucosal environment.

The mucus layer serves as a scaffold and a carbon source for gut microorganisms; conversely, gut microorganisms, including mucin degraders, influence mucin gene expression, glycosylation, and secretion. Conjointly they shield the epithelium from luminal pathogens, antigens, and toxins. Importantly, the mucus layer and gut microbiota are established in parallel during early postnatal life. During this period, the development of gut microbiota and mucus layer is coupled with that of the immune system. Developmental changes of different mucin types can impact the age-dependent patterns of intestinal infection in terms of incidence and severity. Altered mucus layer, dysbiotic microbiota, and abnormal mucus-gut microbiota interaction have the potential for inducing systemic effects, and accompany several intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and radiation-induced mucositis. Early life provides a pivotal window of opportunity to favorably modulate the mucus-microbiota interaction. The support of a health-compatible mucin-microbiota maturation in early life is paramount for long-term health and serves as an important opportunity for clinical intervention.","The support of a health-compatible mucin–microbiota maturation in early life is paramount for long-term health and serves as an important opportunity for clinical intervention."
