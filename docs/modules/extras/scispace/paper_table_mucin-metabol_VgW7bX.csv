Despite that adhesion to mucins is considered critical for the persistence of A. muciniphila in the human intestinal tract, our knowledge of how this intestinal symbiont recognizes and binds to mucins is still limited. Here, we first show that the mucin-binding properties of A. muciniphila are independent of environmental oxygen concentrations and not abolished by pasteurization. We then dissected the mucin-binding properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila by use of a recently developed cell-based mucin array that enables display of the tandem repeats of human mucins with distinct O -glycan patterns and structures. We found that A. muciniphila recognizes the unsialylated LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-R) disaccharide selectively on core2 and core3 O -glycans. This disaccharide epitope is abundantly found on human colonic mucins capped by sialic acids, and we demonstrated that endogenous A. muciniphila neuraminidase activity can uncover the epitope and promote binding. In summary, our study provides insights into the mucin-binding properties important for colonization of a key mucin-foraging bacterium.

Nevertheless, the questions of whether and how specific mucolytic bacteria aid in the increased pathogen susceptibility remain unexplored. Here, we leverage a functionally characterized, 14-member synthetic human microbiota in gnotobiotic mice to deduce which bacteria and functions are responsible for the pathogen susceptibility. Using strain dropouts of mucolytic bacteria from the community, we show that Akkermansia muciniphila renders the host more vulnerable to the mucosal pathogen during fiber deprivation. However, the presence of A. muciniphila reduces pathogen load on a fiber-sufficient diet, highlighting the context-dependent beneficial effects of this mucin specialist. The enhanced pathogen susceptibility is not owing to altered host immune or pathogen responses, but is driven by a combination of increased mucus penetrability and altered activities of A. muciniphila and other community members. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of how discrete functional responses of the same mucolytic bacterium either resist or enhance enteric pathogen susceptibility.","This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of how discrete functional responses of the same mucolytic bacterium either resist or enhance enteric pathogen susceptibility."

Gut microbiota has been causatively linked with the development of both metabolic dysfunctions and gastrointestinal disorders, thus gut dysbiosis in IBS may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. Here, we showed that human gut bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus play a pathogenic role in gut dysbiosis-induced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and IBS. Monoassociation of R. gnavus impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose control in germ-free mice. Mechanistically, treatment of R. gnavus -derived metabolites tryptamine and phenethylamine directly impaired insulin signaling in major metabolic tissues of healthy mice and monkeys and this effect was mediated by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling axis. Moreover, we showed levels of R. gnavus , tryptamine and phenethylamine are positively associated with insulin resistance in T2D patients and IBS patients. Our findings suggest a causal role for tryptamine/phenethylamine-producers in the development of insulin resistance, provide molecular mechanisms for the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in IBS, and highlight the TAAR1 signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome induced by gut dysbiosis.

Akkermansia muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. are commensal microbes colonising the mucus gel layer of the colon. Both species have the capacity to utilise colonic mucin as a substrate. A. muciniphila degrades colonic mucin, while Desulfovibrio spp. metabolise the sulfate moiety of sulfated mucins. Altered abundances of these microorganisms have been reported in ulcerative colitis (UC). However their capacity to bind to human colonic mucin, and whether this binding capacity is affected by changes in mucin associated with UC, remain to be defined.
Methods 
Mucin was isolated from resected colon from control patients undergoing resection for colonic cancer (n = 7) and patients undergoing resection for UC (n = 5). Isolated mucin was purified and printed onto mucin microarrays. Binding of reference strains and three clinical isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. to purified mucin was investigated.
Results 
Both A. muciniphila and Desulfovibro spp. bound to mucin. The reference strain and all clinical isolates of A. muciniphila showed increased binding capacity for UC mucin (p < .005). The Desulfovibrio reference strain showed increased affinity for UC mucin. The mucin binding profiles of clinical isolates of Desulfovibrio spp. were specific to each isolate. Two isolates showed no difference in binding. One UC isolate bound with increased affinity to UC mucin (p < .005).
Conclusion 
These preliminary data suggest that differences exist in the mucin binding capacity of isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. This study highlights the mucin microarray platform as a means of studying the ability of bacteria to interact with colonic mucin in health and disease.","Preliminary data suggest that differences exist in the mucin binding capacity of isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp, which highlights the muc in microarray platform as a means of studying the ability of bacteria to interact with colonic mucin in health and disease."

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify the nutrient utilization- and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production potential of gut microbes in infants during the first year of life. Stool samples were obtained from mothers at 18 weeks of pregnancy and from infants at birth (first stool) at 3, 6, and 12-months of age from the general population-based PreventADALL cohort. We identified the taxonomic and SCFA composition in 100 mother-child pairs. The SCFA production and substrate utilization potential of gut microbes were observed by multiomics (shotgun sequencing and proteomics) on six infants. We found a four-fold increase in relative butyrate levels from 6 to 12 months of infant age. The increase was correlated to Eubacterium rectale and its bacterial network, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii relative abundance, while low butyrate at 12 months was correlated to Ruminococcus gnavus and its associated network of bacteria. Both E. rectale and F. prausnitzii expressed enzymes needed for butyrate production and enzymes related to dietary fiber degradation, while R. gnavus expressed mucus-, fucose, and human milk oligosaccharides (HMO)-related degradation enzymes. Therefore, we believe that the presence of E. rectale, its network, and F. prausnitzii are key bacteria in the transition from an infant- to an adult-like gut microbiota with respect to butyrate production. Our results indicate that the transition from an infant- to an adult-like gut microbiota with respect to butyrate producing bacteria, occurs between 6 and 12 months of infant age. The bacteria associated with the increased butyrate ratio/levels were E. rectale and F. prausnitzii, which potentially utilize a variety of dietary fibers based on the glycoside hydrolases (GHs) expressed. R. gnavus with a negative association to butyrate potentially utilizes mucin, fucose, and HMO components. This knowledge could have future importance in understanding how microbial metabolites can impact infant health and development.","The results indicate that the transition from an infant- to an adult-like gut microbiota with respect to butyrate producing bacteria, occurs between 6 and 12 months of infant age."

In particular, some gut bacteria have the ability to degrade the mucin glycan for nutritional sources. However, the bacterial diversity of mucin-degrading bacteria in human gut microbiota and their role in the gut remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the diversity of mucin-degrading bacteria in the human gut microbiota by an established cultivation-based molecular profiling method. The results showed the gut commensals having the mucin degrading ability were widely distributed in the gut microbiota and were more abundant than previously thought. In addition, many previously uncharacterized mucin degraders were isolated from faecals samples, suggesting the mucin-degrading gut commensals were underappreciated. To gain a better understanding of the interaction between these mucin-degrading gut commensals and the host, the effect of the commensals on intestinal epithelial cells were examined, and the results revealed that the commensals (8 Bacteroides spp., 2 Parabacteroides spp, Akkermanisa muciniphila and Bifidobacterial dentium) incited low level of inflammatory response (IL-8 and TNF-α) but suppressed the inflammatory response induced by E. coli through downregulating the NF-κB pathway. The presence of gut commensals also showed potential in enhancing the epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier function through regulating the mRNA expression of TJ protein genes such as Zo-1, Occludin, Claudin-1 and E-cadherin. Furthermore, the presence of commensal bacteria P. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron and A. muciniphila completely or partly restored the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β induced TJ barrier disruption. In conclusion, these findings indicate that mucin-degrading gut commensals were widely distributed in the gut microbiota and showed anti-inflammatory effect against pathogen infection and potential in modulating the epithelial barrier function.","The results showed the gut commensals having the mucin degrading ability were widely distributed in the gut microbiota and were more abundant than previously thought, and showed anti-inflammatory effect against pathogen infection and potential in modulating the epithelial barrier function."

Disrupted microbiome has been associated with negative health outcomes and especially could promote the onset of enteric infections. To sustain their growth and persistence within the human digestive tract, gut microbes and enteric pathogens rely on two main polysaccharide compartments, namely dietary fibers and mucus carbohydrates. Several evidences suggest that the three-way relationship between gut microbiota, dietary fibers and mucus layer could unravel the capacity of enteric pathogens to colonise the human digestive tract and ultimately lead to infection. The review starts by shedding light on similarities and differences between dietary fibers and mucus carbohydrates structures and functions. Next, we provide an overview of the interactions of these two components with the third partner, namely, the gut microbiota, under health and disease situations. The review will then provide insights into the relevance of using dietary fibers interventions to prevent enteric infections with a focus on gut microbial imbalance and impaired-mucus integrity.

By selecting human individuals from the deeply-phenotyped Estonian Microbiome Cohort (EstMB) we here utilised human-to-mouse faecal microbiota transplantation to explore long-term impacts of repeated antibiotic use on intestinal mucus function. While a healthy mucus layer protects the intestinal epithelium against infection and inflammation, using ex-vivo mucus function analyses of viable colonic tissue explants, we show that microbiota from humans with a history of repeated antibiotic use causes reduced mucus growth rate and increased mucus penetrability compared to healthy controls in the transplanted mice. Moreover, shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified a significantly altered microbiota composition in the antibiotic-shaped microbial community, with known mucus-utilising bacteria, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis, dominating in the gut. The altered microbiota composition was further characterised by a distinct metabolite profile, which may be caused by differential mucus degradation capacity. Consequently, our findings suggest that long-term antibiotic use in humans results in an altered microbial community that has reduced capacity to maintain proper mucus function in the gut.","Repeated antibiotic usage leads to microbiota-dependent mucus defects, altering the gut microbiota composition and function."

A. muciniphila has been correlated with human health in previous studies, but a mechanistic explanation is lacking. In this study, the main site of colonisation was characterised alongside additional conditions, such as differences in colon pH, prebiotic supplementation and variable mucin supply. To overcome the limitations of in vivo studies concerning variations in mucin availability and difficult access to proximal regions of the colon, a dynamic in vitro gut model (SHIME) was used. In this model, A. muciniphila was found to colonise the distal colon compartment more abundantly than the proximal colon ((±8 log copies/ml compared to ±4 log copies/ml) and the preference for the distal compartment was found to be pH-dependent. The addition of mucin caused a specific increase of A. muciniphila (±4.5 log increase over two days), far exceeding the response of other bacteria present, together with an increase in propionate.

For each donor, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize microbial community succession, and the short-chain fatty acid profile was determined from the final community. All three communities reached a steady-state by day seven in which the community composition stabilized. Taxonomic comparisons amongst communities revealed that one of the final communities had Desulfovibrio, another had Akkermansia, and all three shared other members, such as Bacteroides. Metabolic output differences were most notable for one of the donor's communities, with significantly less production of acetate and propionate than the other two communities. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing stable mucin-degrading communities with shared and unique taxa. Furthermore, the mechanisms and efficiencies of mucin degradation across individuals are important for understanding how this community-level process impacts human health.","Mucin degrading microbial consortia are successfully assembled and characterized from human fecal samples.

The molecular cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the gut play an important role in the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis and general health. Here, we studied the impact of a major Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells.

Methods and Results
Our results showed that R. gnavus E1 specifically increases the expression and the glycosylation level of the intestinal glyco-conjugates by goblet cells in the colonic mucosa of mono-associated mice with R. gnavus E1 as well as in human HT29-MTX cells. Such an effect was mediated through induction of the level of mRNA encoding for the major intestinal gel-forming mucin such as MUC2 and various glycosyltransferase enzymes.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time that R. gnavus E1 possess the ability to modulate the glycosylation profile of the glyco-conjugate molecules and mucus in goblet cells.

Significance and Impact of the Study
Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. gnavus E1 modified specifically the glycosylation pattern and MUC2 expression by means of a small soluble factor of peptidic nature (<3 kDa) and heat stable in the HT29-MTX cell.","The impact of a major Gram‐positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus, is studied on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells."

The advent of metagenomics has linked R. gnavus with various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, and diabetes mellitus (DM), which has become a growing area of investigation. The initial focus of research primarily centered on assessing the abundance of R. gnavus and its potential association with disease presentation, taking into account variations in sample size, sequencing and analysis methods. However, recent investigations have shifted towards elucidating the underlying mechanistic pathways through which R. gnavus may contribute to disease manifestation. In this comprehensive review, we aim to provide an updated synthesis of the current literature on R. gnavus in the context of IBD, obesity, and DM. We critically analyze relevant studies and summarize the potential molecular mediators implicated in the association between R. gnavus and these diseases. Across numerous studies, various molecules such as methylation-controlled J (MCJ), glucopolysaccharides, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), interleukin(IL)-10, IL-17, and capric acid have been proposed as potential contributors to the link between R. gnavus and IBD. Similarly, in the realm of obesity, molecules such as hydrogen peroxide, butyrate, and UDCA have been suggested as potential mediators, while glycine ursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) has been implicated in the connection between R. gnavus and DM. Furthermore, it is imperative to emphasize the necessity for additional studies to evaluate the potential efficacy of targeting pathways associated with R. gnavus as a viable strategy for managing these diseases. These findings have significantly expanded our understanding of the functional role of R. gnavus in the context of IBD, obesity, and DM. This review aims to offer updated insights into the role and potential mechanisms of R. gnavus, as well as potential strategies for the treatment of these diseases.","R. gnavus is associated with IBD, obesity, and DM.

Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes. We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes were analyzed using PanPhlAn. We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients. To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R. gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199 IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut. This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD.","This study finds a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD."

The outer mucus layer in the large intestine forms a niche that attracts specific gut microbiota members of which several gut commensals can degrade mucin. Mucin glycan degradation is a complex process that requires a broad range of glycan degrading enzymes, as mucin glycans are intricate and diverse molecules. Consequently, it is hypothesized that microbial mucin breakdown requires concerted action of various enzymes in a network of multiple resident microbes in the gut mucosa. This review investigates the evolutionary relationships of microbial carbohydrate-active enzymes that are potentially involved in mucin glycan degradation and focuses on the role that microbial enzymes play in the degradation of gut mucin glycans in microbial cross-feeding and syntrophic interactions.","This review explores the role of microbial glycosyl hydrolases in gut mucosa, investigating evolutionary relationships and their involvement in mucin glycan degradation, microbial cross-feeding, and syntrophic interactions in the gut microbiota."

Schroeder","10.1093/GASTRO/GOY052","","The intestinal tract is inhabited by a tremendous number of microorganisms, termed the gut microbiota. These microorganisms live in a mutualistic relationship with their host and assist in the degradation of complex carbohydrates. Although the gut microbiota is generally considered beneficial, the vast number of microbial cells also form a permanent threat to the host. Thus, the intestinal epithelium is covered with a dense layer of mucus to prevent translocation of the gut microbiota into underlying tissues. Intestinal mucus is an organized glycoprotein network with a host-specific glycan structure. While the mucus layer has long been considered a passive, host-designed barrier, recent studies showed that maturation and function of the mucus layer are strongly influenced by the gut microbiota. In return, the glycan repertoire of mucins can select for distinct mucosa-associated bacteria that are able to bind or degrade specific mucin glycans as a nutrient source. Because the intestinal mucus layer is at the crucial interface between host and microbes, its breakdown leads to gut bacterial encroachment that can eventually cause inflammation and infection. Accordingly, a dysfunctional mucus layer has been observed in colitis in mice and humans. Moreover, the increased consumption of a low-fiber Western-style diet in our modern society has recently been demonstrated to cause bacteria-mediated defects of the intestinal mucus layer. Here, I will review current knowledge on the interaction between gut bacteria and the intestinal mucus layer in health and disease. Understanding the molecular details of this host-microbe interaction may contribute to the development of novel treatment options for diseases involving a dysfunctional mucus layer, such as ulcerative colitis.","Current knowledge on the interaction between gut bacteria and the intestinal mucus layer in health and disease is reviewed to contribute to the development of novel treatment options for diseases involving a dysfunctional mucuslayer, such as ulcerative colitis."

This bacterium resides in the mucus layer of its host and regulates intestinal homeostasis and intestinal barrier integrity by affecting host signaling pathways. However, it remains unknown how the expression of genes encoding extracellular proteins is regulated in response to dynamic mucosal environments. In this study, we elucidated the effect of mucin on the gene expression and probiotic traits of A. muciniphila. Transcriptome analysis showed that the genes encoding most mucin-degrading enzymes were significantly upregulated in the presence of mucin. By contrast, most genes involved in glycolysis and energy metabolic pathways were upregulated under mucin-depleted conditions. Interestingly, the absence of mucin resulted in the upregulation of 79 genes encoding secreted protein candidates, including Amuc-1100 as well as members of major protein secretion systems. These transcript level changes were consistent with the fact that administration of A. muciniphila grown under mucin-depleted conditions to high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice reduced obesity and improved intestinal barrier integrity more efficiently than administration of A. muciniphila grown under mucin-containing conditions. In conclusion, mucin content in the growth medium plays a critical role in the improvement by A. muciniphila of high-fat diet-induced obesity, intestinal inflammation, and compromised intestinal barrier integrity related to a decrease in goblet cell density.

Recently, research on the MAM has gained momentum due to its significant role in immune and metabolic health. However, the study of the MAM is limited by conventional experimental techniques, as sampling this microbiome often requires invasive procedures, making in vivo research challenging. Additionally, obtaining samples from the MAM can compromise the lumen, complicating simultaneous studies of both the MAM and the lumen. To address these limitations, we present the TIM-2 muc , an advanced version of the colonic in vitro model TIM-2, which includes a mucus compartment comprising both colonic mucus beads - Gut 3 Beads and an electrospun sheet coated with Gut 3 Gel. To validate whether the integrated mucus compartment behaves like the in vivo MAM, we examined the bacterial composition, alpha and beta diversity, and the MAM’s composition compared to the lumen compartment of both the TIM-2 muc and the conventional TIM-2 model. Our findings suggest that the MAM in the TIM-2 muc model closely resembles its in vivo counterpart, thereby enhancing the physiological relevance of the luminal microbiome. TIM-2 muc , an advanced TIM-2 model, presents a novel, precise, standardized, and non-invasive method for studying the MAM and LM simultaneously.

Central to their survival is the ability to metabolise complex dietary and host-derived glycans including intestinal mucins. The latter are critical components of the gut epithelium glycocalyx and mucus barriers, essential for microbiota-gut homeostasis and protection from infections by pathogens. The prominent and model human gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) is a versatile and highly efficient complex glycan degrader thanks to the expansion of gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilisation loci (PULs) in its genome. While the mechanisms for several singular dietary glycan-induced PULs have been elucidated, studies on the 16-18 mucin-induced PULs in B. theta significantly lag behind. A combination of the scale and complexity of B. theta transcriptomic response to mucins and complex glycan configurations of mucins represent major hurdles for the functional characterisation of the mucin induced PULs. As a result, there is very limited knowledge on how mucin metabolism is coordinated in B. theta and what specific PULs, genes and metabolites are critical for mucin-B. theta, and more generally mucin-microbiota interactions and their importance in microbiota-gut homeostasis. Here we show that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50, (i) encodes activities consistent with a machinery that couples the processing of mucin-O glycan glycoproteins with the metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), an abundant mucin O-glycan sugar; (ii) is important for competitive growth on mucins in-vitro; (iii) encodes a key kinase enzyme (BT4240) that is critical for GalNAc metabolism and (iv) has related PULs encoded by a range of prominent Bacteroides species in the human gut. Furthermore, BT4240 kinase was also critical for glycosaminoglycan metabolism, thus extending the PULs function beyond mucins. Our work advances our understanding of the vital metabolic processes that govern mucosal glycoprotein metabolism and by implication, a key aspect of host-microbiota interactions at mucosal surfaces and highlight GalNAc as a key metabolite targeted for competitive growth.","This work shows that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50 encodes activities consistent with a machinery that couples the processing of mucin-O glycan glycoproteins with the metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), an abundant mucin O-glycan sugar that is important for competitive growth on mucins in-vitro."

Seven days of fiber-deficiency affected intestinal anatomy and physiology, seen by reduced intestinal length and loss of the colonic crypt-structure. Moreover, the mucus layer was diminished, muc2 expression decreased, and impaired mucus secretion was detected by stable isotope probing. Quantitative microbiome profiling of the gut microbiota showed a diet-induced reduction in bacterial load and decreased diversity across the intestinal tract, including taxa with fiber-degrading and butyrate-producing capabilities. Most importantly, there was little change in the absolute abundance of known mucus-degrading bacteria, although, due to the general loss of taxa, relative abundance would erroneously indicate an increase in mucus degraders. These findings underscore the importance of using quantitative methods in microbiome research, suggesting erosion of the mucus layer during fiber deprivation is due to diminished mucus production rather than overgrowth of mucus degraders.","Quantitative microbiome profiling of the gut microbiota showed a diet-induced reduction in bacterial load and decreased diversity across the intestinal tract, including taxa with fiber-degrading and butyrate-producing capabilities, and underscores the importance of using quantitative methods in microbiome research."

However, the genetic factors that establish gut colonization and virulence remain elusive due to the lack of a system for genetic modification. This study develops several genetic tools, including a shuttle vector, an inducible promoter, fluorescent proteins, and gene disruption or deletion systems in R. gnavus to identify the genes involved in R. gnavus colonization. Using these genetic tools, we found the respective sortase enzymes necessary for both cell wall localization of the superantigens and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) production in R. gnavus ATCC 29149. We identified the putative new gene cluster responsible for CPS production in the adjacent region of the sortase gene and confirmed that CPS production is crucial for competitive fitness during colonization in germ-free mouse intestines and that CPS production is inversely correlated with the inflammatory activity of R. gnavus . Furthermore, CPS cluster-possessing strains tended to be more prevalent in healthy human isolates compared to those from Crohn’s disease patients. This implies that CPS production is involved in their inflammatory activities and pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as IBD.

Predominantly composed of mucin 2 (MUC2), a glycosylation-rich protein, the mucus layer forms a gel-like coating that covers the colonic epithelium surface. This layer provides a habitat for intestinal microorganisms, which can utilize mucin glycans present in the mucus layer as a sustainable source of nutrients. Additionally, metabolites produced by the microbiota during the metabolism of mucus glycans have a profound impact on host health. Under normal conditions, the production and consumption of mucus maintain a dynamic balance. However, several studies have demonstrated that certain factors, such as dietary fiber deficiency, can enhance the metabolism of mucus glycans by gut bacteria, thereby disturbing this balance and weakening the mucus barrier function of the mucus layer. To better understand the occurrence and development of colon-related diseases, it is crucial to investigate the complex metabolic patterns of mucus glycosylation by intestinal microorganisms. Our objective was to comprehensively review these patterns in order to clarify the effects of mucus layer glycan metabolism by intestinal microorganisms on the host.

Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes. We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes were analyzed using PanPhlAn. We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients. To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R. gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199 IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut. This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD.","In this article, the authors performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples) and identified strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes."

The molecular scaffolding of mucus comprises hydrated mucins, which are very high-molecular mass, glycosylated glycoproteins presenting arrays of O-linked glycans. Mucins are integral to microbial interactions with epithelial surfaces and have potential roles in microbial trophism, the presentation of ligands to block microbial binding or stabilize colonization and the provision of feedstocks for microbial metabolism. The protective physicochemical properties of mucus are attributable to their high carbohydrate content. Microbes are capable of expressing specific lectins and mucin-degrading enzymes to engage with, utilize, and penetrate mucus gels. Normally, the dynamic nature of such gels represents an optimal adaptation through host–microbial crosstalk, enabling the maintenance of barrier function through the coregulation of mucus turnover and microbial ecology. Mucin expression and glycosylation are biologically responsive to changes in the sub- and supra-mucosal environment and are significantly influenced by inflammation and microbial colonization. Impairment of mucus gel turnover may lead to abnormal colonization, inflammatory pathology, and biofilm formation.","Mucin expression and glycosylation are biologically responsive to changes in the sub- and supra-mucosal environment and are significantly influenced by inflammation and microbial colonization."

The 727-amino-acid (aa) deduced Aga2 protein shares approximately 45% identity with Aga1. Both Aga1 and Aga2 expressed in Escherichia coli showed strict specificity for α-linked galactose.

Gut microbiota-mucosa-epithelial cells co-exist in an intricate three-way relationship that underpins gut homeostasis, and ultimately influences health and disease conditions. The O-glycans of mucin glycoproteins have been uncovered as a centrepiece of this system, although understanding the phenomena at play at the molecular level has been challenging and subject to significant traction over the last years. The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent advances in the phenomena that mediate microbiota and mucus multidirectional interactions in the human gut.


RECENT FINDINGS
The mucus biosynthesis and degradation by both commensal and pathogenic bacteria is under tight regulation and involves hundreds of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and transporters. The fucosylation of O-glycans from mucin-2 seems to dictate binding by pathogenic species and to influence their virulence. Less clear is the influence of O-glycans in quorum sensing and biofilm formation. We have reviewed the advances in the in vitro models available to recreate the phenomena that capture the physiological context of the intestinal environment, emphasising models that include mucus and other aspects relevant to the physiological context.


SUMMARY
The recent findings highlight the importance of merging advances in analytical (glycans analysis) and omics techniques along with original robust in vitro models that enable to deconstruct part of the high complexity of the living gut and expand our understanding of the microbes-mucosa relationships and their significance in health and disease.","The recent findings highlight the importance of merging advances in analytical (glycans analysis) and omics techniques along with original robust in vitro models that enable to deconstruct part of the high complexity of the living gut and expand the understanding of the microbes-mucosa relationships and their significance in health and disease."

Regenerating islet-derived protein 3 γ (Reg3γ), the archetypal intestinal antimicrobial peptide, is critical for maintaining host-microbe interactions. Expression of Reg3γ is known to be regulated by the microbiota through two different pathways, although it remains unknown whether specific Reg3γ-inducing bacteria act via one or both of these pathways. In recent work, we identified Ruminococcus gnavus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri as commensal bacteria able to induce Reg3g expression. In this study, we show these bacteria require myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 and group 3 innate lymphoid cells for induction of Reg3γ in mice. Interestingly, we find that R. gnavus and L. reuteri suppress Reg3γ in the absence of either myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 or group 3 innate lymphoid cells. In addition, we demonstrate that colonization by these bacteria is not required for induction of Reg3γ, which occurs several days after transient exposure to the organisms.

The mucus associated biofilm-like community excluded bacteria belonging to phylum Proteobacteria. Additionally, it was significantly more diverse and consisted of bacterial species that were unique to it. By employing germ-free mice deficient in T and B lymphocytes we found that formation of biofilm-like structure was independent of adaptive immunity. Instead the integrity of biofilm-like community depended on Gram-positive commensals such as Clostridia. Additionally, biofilm-like community in the mucus lost fewer Clostridia and showed smaller bloom of Proteobacteria compared to the lumen upon antibiotic treatment. When subjected to time restricted feeding biofilm like structure significantly enhanced in size and showed enrichment of Clostridia.

Coculturing experiments of A. muciniphila with non-mucus-degrading butyrate-producing bacteria Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii resulted in syntrophic growth and production of butyrate. In addition, we demonstrate that the production of pseudovitamin B12 by E. hallii results in production of propionate by A. muciniphila, which suggests that this syntrophy is indeed bidirectional. These data are proof of concept for syntrophic and other symbiotic microbe-microbe interactions at the intestinal mucosal interface.

 Mucus-digesting Ruminococcus gnavus (R. gnavus), adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are enriched in active Crohn’s disease (CD) patients compared to healthy subjects. Dual colonization of R. gnavus and E. coli LF82 in ex-germ-free mice enhanced distal colitis and H2S production in cecal contents. R. gnavus pre-digestion of mucus enhanced the ileal CD isolate AIEC LF82 growth and H2S production in vitro. H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo along with related LF82 adhesion gene expression and Caco-2 cell expression of CEACAM6, a receptor for AIEC ligand FimH. Interactions between other CD-derived AIEC/non-AIEC and R. gnavus are unknown.
 
 
 
 Different AIEC and non-AIEC may grow and produce H2S differently using mucus digested by R. gnavus, which releases mucus-derived monosaccharides and sulfur substrates.
 
 
 
 We studied CD-derived clinical isolates of AIEC 541-15 (phylotype A), 541-1 (B1), LF82 and NRG857c (B2) and non-AIEC T75 (A) and lab strain K12 (A). M9 minimal media was supplemented with porcine gastric mucin (PGM), ileal (MIM) and colonic (MCoM) mucus isolated from germ-free mice. We measured growth kinetics and H2S production by these AIEC and non-AIEC following culture with sterile supernatants of each mucin/mucus media precultured with or without R. gnavus, monosaccharides obtained by R. gnavus digestion of mucus, and several sulfur substrates in the gut added to M9 minimal media.
 
 
 
 AIEC, especially LF82 (B2), grew better with ileal mucus aerobically and, to a lesser extent, anaerobically than non-AIEC strains, with even greater AIEC growth with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus (Fig.1). AIEC produced more H2S with R. gnavus-precultured mucus than with mucus alone. R. gnavus digestion of PGM released mucus monosaccharides (Fig.2A). AIEC strains grew differently with each monosaccharide constituent of R. gnavus pre-digested PGM. AIEC grew better than non-AIEC with each monosaccharide in aerobic conditions, but AIEC (B2) grew better than others in all monosaccharides in anaerobic conditions (Fig.2B). Amongst mucus-relevant sulfur substrates, L-cysteine was the only substrate to enhance E. coli H2S production by all AIEC and non-AIEC strains. All mucus-relevant sulfur substrates supported R. gnavus survival for 24 hrs, while H2S sustained R. gnavus for 48 hrs in minimum media.
 
 
 
 AIEC grew better and produced more H2S with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus suggesting that co-existence of AIEC with R. gnavus mutually support each other and may explain why they are often observed together in active CD patients. In addition, enhanced AIEC growth with ileal vs. colonic mucus may explain why AIEC are frequently isolated from ileal CD patients. AIEC phylotype growth differences with mucus substrates may explain their persistence in the ileal mucosa.

They are associated with perturbation of the intestinal microbiota, and with alteration and crossing of the mucus barrier by the commensal bacteria that feed on it. In the process of mucus catabolism and invasion by gut bacteria, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play a critical role since mucus is mainly made up by O- and N-glycans. Moreover, the occurrence of IBD seems to be associated with low-fiber diets. Conversely, supplementation with oligosaccharides, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are structurally similar to intestinal mucins and could thus compete with them towards bacterial mucus-degrading CAZymes, has been suggested to prevent inflammation. In this mini-review, we will establish the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens, with a particular focus on the present technological opportunities available to further the discovery of mucus-degrading CAZymes within the entire gut microbiome, by coupling microfluidics with metagenomics and culturomics.

Maintaining a robust epithelial barrier sequesters these potentially harmful substances in the lumen, preventing absorption into the systemic circulation. Normal functioning of this barrier is central in diverse physiological processes including digestion, immunity, inflammation, and gut-brain signaling. One crucial component of the barrier is the mucus layer covering the epithelium. There is increased appreciation of the importance of mucus in maintenance of the gut barrier, and how dysregulation of the mucus layer contributes to several common gastrointestinal pathologies. This manuscript reviews the physical and chemical properties of mucus, its maintenance and turnover, and its role in maintaining gut barrier integrity. The dynamic interactions of the mucus layer within the gut ecosystem are illustrated by highlighting how a weakened mucus layer or defective mucus production facilitate pathogenic microbial colonization and mucosal biofilm formation. These may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases or result in secretion and mucosal damage and inflammation in bile acid diarrhea. A final goal is to review how certain dietary factors, especially low-fiber diets and emulsifiers common in Western diets, can harm the mucus layer. This report summarizes evidence from preclinical and human studies that document damage to the mucus layer, and reviews approaches including diets and probiotics that promote a healthy mucus layer and break down pathogenic biofilms, thereby potentially preventing and/or treating gastrointestinal diseases that impact mucosal integrity.

Despite the high density of bacteria that colonize the lower airways, nutrient sources that sustain bacterial growth in vivo, and how those nutrients are derived, are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the possibility that mucins serve as an important carbon reservoir for the CF lung microbiota. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins in isolation, we found that anaerobic, mucin-fermenting bacteria could stimulate the robust growth of CF pathogens when provided intact mucins as a sole carbon source. 16S rRNA sequencing and enrichment culturing of sputum also identified that mucin-degrading anaerobes are ubiquitous in the airways of CF patients. The collective fermentative metabolism of these mucin-degrading communities in vitro generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during growth on mucin, and the same metabolites were also found in abundance within expectorated sputum. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened expression of genes required for the catabolism of propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data provide evidence for an important role of mucin fermenting bacteria in the carbon flux of the lower airways.

Bacteria colonizing the mucus layer have evolved to use mucin as a carbon and energy source. One of the members of the mucosa-associated microbiota is Akkermansia muciniphila, which is capable of producing an extensive repertoire of mucin-degrading enzymes. To further study the substrate utilization abilities of A. muciniphila, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model to test amino acid auxotrophy, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar-degrading capacities. The model-supported predictions were validated by in vitro experiments, which showed A. muciniphila to be able to utilize the mucin-derived monosaccharides fucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Growth was also observed on N-acetylgalactosamine, even though the metabolic model did not predict this. The uptake of these sugars, as well as the nonmucin sugar glucose, was enhanced in the presence of mucin, indicating that additional mucin-derived components are needed for optimal growth. An analysis of whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) comparing the gene expression of A. muciniphila grown on mucin with that of the same bacterium grown on glucose confirmed the activity of the genes involved in mucin degradation and revealed most of these to be upregulated in the presence of mucin. The transcriptional response was confirmed by a proteome analysis, altogether revealing a hierarchy in the use of sugars and reflecting the adaptation of A. muciniphila to the mucosal environment.

Various gut microbial species possess diverse hydrolytic enzymes and catabolic pathways for breaking down mucin glycans, resulting in competition for the limited nutrients within the gut environment. Adherence to mucin glycans represents a crucial strategy used by gut microbes to access nutrient reservoirs. Understanding these properties is pivotal for comprehending the survival mechanisms of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. However, characterization of individual strains within the vast array of coexisting bacteria in the microbiome is challenging. To investigate this, we developed mucin-immobilized particles by immobilizing porcine gastric mucin (PGM) onto glass beads chemically modified with boronic acid. These PGM-immobilized particles were then anaerobically cultured with human fecal microbiota, and the bacteria adhering to PGM were isolated. Interestingly, the microbiome composition remained largely unchanged irrespective of PGM immobilization. Nonetheless, bacteria isolated from PGM-immobilized glass particles exhibited notably higher N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity compared to the control beads. Furthermore, Bacteroides strains isolated from PGM-immobilized glass particles displayed enhanced adhesive and metabolic properties to PGM. These findings underscore the utility of PGM particles in enriching and isolating specific microbes. Moreover, they highlight substantial differences in microbial properties at the strain level. We anticipate that PGM-immobilized particles will advance culture-based microbiome research, emphasizing the significance of strain-level characterization.

Metabolism of mucin glycans by gut bacteria represents a crucial strategy for accessing nutrient reservoirs. The efficacy of mucin glycan utilization among gut bacteria hinges on the metabolic capabilities of individual strains, necessitating meticulous strain-level characterization. In this investigation, we used glass beads chemically immobilized with mucins to selectively enrich bacteria from fecal fermentation cultures, based on their superior adhesion to and metabolism of mucin glycoproteins. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that the physical interactions between bacteria and mucin glycoprotein components directly correlate with their capacity to utilize mucins as nutrient sources. Furthermore, our study implies that physical proximity may significantly influence bacterial nutrient acquisition within the ecosystem, facilitating gut bacteria's access to carbohydrate components.","Researchers developed mucin-immobilized particles to study gut microbiome diversity, finding that specific bacteria strains exhibit enhanced adhesive and metabolic properties to mucin, highlighting the importance of strain-level characterization in understanding gut bacteria's nutrient acquisition strategies."

The fecal microbiota of Fut2− mice that lack fucosylated host glycans show decreased alpha diversity relative to Fut2+ mice and exhibit significant differences in community composition. A glucose-rich plant polysaccharide-deficient (PD) diet exerted a strong effect on the microbiota membership but eliminated the effect of Fut2 genotype. Additionally fecal metabolites predicted host genotype in mice on a polysaccharide-rich standard diet but not on a PD diet. A more detailed mechanistic analysis of these interactions involved colonization of gnotobiotic Fut2+ and Fut2− mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent member of the human gut microbiota known to adaptively forage host mucosal glycans when dietary polysaccharides are absent. Within Fut2− mice, the B. thetaiotaomicron fucose catabolic pathway was markedly down-regulated, whereas BT4241–4247, an operon responsive to terminal β-galactose, the precursor that accumulates in the Fut2− mice, was significantly up-regulated.

The integrity of the colonic mucus barrier is essential for overall human health and well-being, with the mucin specialist Akkermanisa muciniphila being associated with a healthy mucus layer. Competition, particularly between the specialist and generalists like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, may lead to mucus layer erosion, especially during periods of dietary fiber deprivation. Our model treats the colon as a gut reactor system, dividing it into two compartments that represent the lumen and the mucus of the gut, resulting in a complex system of ordinary differential equations with a large and uncertain parameter space. To understand the influence of model parameters on long-term behavior, we employ a random forest classifier, a supervised machine learning method. Additionally, a variance-based sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the sensitivity of steady-state values to changes in model parameter inputs. By constructing this model, we can investigate the underlying mechanisms that control gut microbiota composition and function, free from confounding factors. ","A mathematical model of a glycan generalist and a mucin specialist in a two-compartment chemostat model of the human colon is introduced to characterize the influence of dietary fiber and mucin supply on the abundance of mucin-degrading species within the gut ecosystem."

We examined how the breakdown of prebiotic dietary fibers by the gut microbiome affects mucin secretion by intestinal epithelial cells. Metagenomic analyses of in vitro gut microbiome consortia revealed taxonomic profiles and genetic diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes that digest polysaccharides. Two independent consortia exhibited different abilities to produce acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid via the fermentation of polysaccharides derived from dietary fibers of grains and mushrooms. Although acetic acid generally had the highest concentration, the ratios of butyric acid and propionic acid to acetic acid varied depending on the polysaccharide source. These short-chain fatty acids affected morphological differentiation and mucin secretion in HT-29 human intestinal epithelial cells. These results suggest that prebiotic dietary fibers can be digested and metabolized by the gut microbiome to short-chain fatty acids, which can affect gut epithelial cells both directly and indirectly via the modulation of the gut microbiota and their enzymes. ","Prebiotic dietary fibers are broken down by gut microbiome consortia into short-chain fatty acids, which stimulate mucin secretion in intestinal epithelial cells, highlighting the gut microbiota's role in modulating human health through dietary fiber metabolism."

This review examines the dualistic nature of A. muciniphila mucin degradation, exploring its potential benefits and risks. As a mucin specialist, A. muciniphila uses glycosyl hydrolases and mucinases to degrade mucins, producing metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), succinate, and other compounds. These metabolites benefit host health and cross-feed other commensal microbes, such as butyrate producers. A. muciniphila levels are inversely correlated with several disease states, such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory states, and administration of A. muciniphila has been found by several groups to restore and maintain gut homeostasis. However, under certain conditions, such as low dietary fiber or conditions with an altered gut microbiota, excessive mucin degradation by A. muciniphila can compromise the mucus barrier, increasing susceptibility to inflammation, infection, and pathogenic overgrowth. Elevated A. muciniphila levels have been associated with various diseases and medications, including graft versus host disease (GVHD) and irradiation, and shown to exacerbate infections by enteric pathogens. The context-dependent effects of A. muciniphila and mucin degradation underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of its interactions with the host and microbial community. This review aims to provide a balanced perspective on the implications of gut microbial mucus degradation, highlighting that it can be good, and it can be bad depending on the context. ","Akkermansia muciniphila's mucin degradation has dualistic effects: beneficially producing SCFAs and maintaining gut homeostasis, but also compromising the mucus barrier and increasing susceptibility to inflammation and infection under certain conditions."

Here, we used an array of omics techniques including glycomics to examine the effect of dietary fiber consumption on the gut microbiota, colonic mucin O-glycosylation and host physiology of high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. The high-fat diet group had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and altered liver proteome, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid production compared to normal chow diet group. While dietary fiber inclusion did not reverse all high fat-induced modifications, it resulted in specific changes, including an increase in the relative abundance of bacterial families with known fiber digesters and a higher propionate concentration. Conversely, colonic mucin O-glycosylation remained similar between the normal chow and high-fat diet groups, while dietary fiber intervention resulted in major alterations in O-glycosylation. Correlation network analysis revealed previously undescribed associations between specific bacteria and mucin glycan structures. For example, the relative abundance of the bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis positively correlated with glycan structures containing one terminal fucose and correlated negatively with glycans containing two terminal fucose residues or with both an N-acetylneuraminic acid and a sulfate residue. This is the first comprehensive report of the impact of dietary fiber on the colonic mucin O-glycosylation and associations of these mucosal glycans with specific gut bacteria.","This is the first comprehensive report of the impact of dietary fiber on the colonic mucin O-glycosylation and associations of these mucosal glycans with specific gut bacteria."

Mucins are decorated in a diverse array of O-glycans, providing nutrients and attachment sites for microbes. Dysbiosis of the microbiota, and alterations in mucin glycosylation have been associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, the causal relationship between these two factors remains unclear. Here, we employed a multidisciplinary approach to address this relationship, and the molecular mechanisms mediating these changes. Mucosal lavages and biopsies obtained from the sigmoid and ascending colon of patients were used to assess alterations in the mucosal microbiota and the glycosylation of associated mucus in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Secondly, in vitro growth assays and gnotobiotic mouse experiments were performed to investigate the reciprocal role of mucin-degrading bacteria in the modulation of mucin O-glycosylation.
These analyses highlighted inter-patient variability, but a similar microbial composition between colonic sites. In contrast, mucin glycosylation and the expression of glycosyltransferases was regio-specific. In UC, changes in the abundances of bacterial groups, including a decrease in the A. muciniphila to R. gnavus ratio were apparent. UC mucins displayed a decrease in fucosylation, increase in sialylation, and a decrease in many complex glycan structures found in abundance in controls. In vitro growth assays suggested that UC-like mucin glycosylation impaired A. muciniphila growth, whilst R. gnavus remained unaffected, potentially explaining changes in these species in UC. Furthermore, gnotobiotic mouse experiments showed that A. muciniphila and R. gnavus were able to remodel mucin glycosylation.
Our findings suggest a multifactorial dysregulation at the epithelial interface in IBD, where mucus-associated microbiota and mucin glycosylation are interdependent. It is likely that an initial disruption in either of these components drives alterations in other mucosal constituents, propagating disease and exacerbating inflammation.","A multifactorial dysregulation at the epithelial interface in IBD, where mucus-associated microbiota and mucin glycosylation are interdependent is suggested, likely that an initial disruption in either of these components drives alterations in other mucosal constituents, propagating disease and exacerbating inflammation."

Mucin glycan utilization requires the removal of protective caps, notably fucose and sialic acid, but the enzymatic details of this process remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the specificities of ten A. muciniphila glycoside hydrolases, which collectively remove all known sialyl and fucosyl mucin caps including those on double-sulfated epitopes. Structural analyses revealed an unprecedented fucosidase modular arrangement and explained the sialyl T-antigen specificity of a sialidase of a previously unknown family. Cell-attached sialidases and fucosidases displayed mucin-binding and their inhibition abolished growth of A. muciniphila on mucin. Remarkably, neither the sialic acid nor fucose contributed to A. muciniphila growth, but instead promoted butyrate production by co-cultured Clostridia. This study brings unprecedented mechanistic insight into the initiation of mucin O -glycan degradation by A. muciniphila and nutrient sharing between mucus-associated bacteria.

"Cross-feeding interactions of gut symbionts driven by human milk oligosaccharidesand mucins","https://scispace.com/paper/cross-feeding-interactions-of-gut-symbionts-driven-by-human-2mbndfw0ud","2018","Dissertation","","Loo Wee Chia","10.18174/444432","","The co-evolution of the human host and the gut microbiota has led to bacterial adaption to forage on host-produced glycans such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) and mucins. In early life, the HMOS that are present in mother milk contribute to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota. Furthermore, mucins that cover the intestinal lining create a stable niche for bacterial colonization throughout a person’s life. Due to the highly complex nature of these host-secreted glycans, bacteria equipped with specific glycan-degrading enzymes can exploit them as substrate for growth. Subsequently, the glycan-degrading bacteria can drive microbial networks via cross-feeding. The glycan-foraging microbial population exerts a large influence on the host physiology, by influencing the immune, metabolic, and neurological development early in life, and by conferring colonisation resistance throughout life. The work described in this thesis aims to improve our understanding of the metabolic dependencies between the milk- and mucin-degrading microbes (Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and butyrate-producing bacteria (Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). Bacteria-derived butyrate is the preferred energy source for host epithelial cells and is associated with a range of beneficial effects including enhancement of colonic barrier function, increased satiety, and protection against inflammation, and cancer. In the introductory chapter, the role of human milk and mucin glycans in fostering the gut microbial network is discussed. As such, the molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented. In Chapter 2 and 3, the role of HMOS as selective substrates for microbial growth that drive the establishment of the infant gut microbiota was investigated. At this developmental stage, HMOS promote the dominance of bifidobacteria from the Actinobacteria phylum. Upon weaning, the gut microbiota shifts towards an adult gut microbiota composition that is predominantly comprised of bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. In chapter 2, the interaction between a HMOS-degrader, Bifidobacterium infantis (Actinobacteria phylum) and a butyrogenic non-HMOS-degrader, Anaerostipes caccae (a member of the Lachnospiraceae from the Firmicutes phylum) was studied. Anaerostipes caccae in monoculture was not able to metabolise lactose or HMOS but its growth and concomitant butyrate production were detected in co-cultures with Bifidobacterium infantis. Anaerostipes caccae was sustained by cross-feeding on the monosaccharides, lactate and acetate derived from Bifidobacterium infantis. Bifidobacterium infantis fully degraded lactose and the complete range of low molecular weight HMOS, pointing towards the key ecological role of bifidobacteria in providing substrates for other important emerging species in the infant gut. The gradual shift of the microbiota composition in the ecosystem contributing to the slow induction of butyrate could also be important for gut maturation. In chapter 3, the microbial network formation in the infant gut driven by another HMOS-degrading species, namely Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was studied. We showed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could metabolise lactose and HMOS. The bacterium showed different preference for specific HMOS structures when grown in co-culture. Subsequently, Anaerostipes caccae cross-fed on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-derived monosaccharides, lactate and acetate for growth and butyrate production. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron might drive the establishment of the microbial network in the infant gut, leading to the sequential establishment of adult-like functional groups such as lactate-utilising and butyrate-producing bacteria. Furthermore, we observed stereospecific lactate isomer production in which Bacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. produced predominantly D- and L-lactate, respectively. The distinct lactate isomer production by these major glycans-degrading genera might affect the gut microbiota compositions by differential cross-feeding interaction with the lactate-utilisers. Chapter 4 and 5 studied the role of mucins in creating a micro-environment that leads to the formation of a microbial network at the intestinal mucosal layer. In chapter 4, we demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut symbiont specialised in mucin degradation, could support the growth of the butyrate-producing cross-feeders Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Akkermansia muciniphila metabolised the complex mucin glycans into short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and 1,2-propanediol as well as the mucin-derived sugars. Subsequently, acetate and the liberated sugars could be used by the butyrate-producers for growth and concomitant butyrate production. Interestingly, a bidirectional cross-feeding was observed between Akkermansia muciniphila and Eubacterium hallii. Pseudo-vitamin B12 produced by Eubacterium hallii facilitated propionate production by Akkermansia muciniphila via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Propionate could be beneficial to the human host by regulating satiety and lipid biosynthesis in the liver, indicative of a mutualistic host-microbial interaction driven by mucin glycans. In chapter 5, we studied the molecular mechanism of cross-feeding between Akkermansia muciniphila and Anaerostipes caccae by metatranscriptomics. We observed a differential transcriptional response of Akkermansia muciniphila grown in monoculture as compared to a co-culture together with Anaerostipes caccae. In particular, the expression of the extracellular mucin-degrading enzymes by Akkermansia muciniphila was heightened in co-cultures. As a result, the monosaccharides liberated from the breakdown of mucin oligosaccharides chain could support the central metabolism of both Akkermansia muciniphila and the butyrate-producer. This suggested that Akkermansia muciniphila plays a key role in supporting the microbial community at the mucosal environment of the intestine by increasing the availability of substrates. In summary, this thesis demonstrated the key functional role of milk- and mucin-degrading symbionts in fostering a butyrogenic microbial network via cross-feeding. Ecologically, HMOS-degraders are critical to drive the establishment of a healthy infant gut microbiota, whilst mucin-degraders are vital to maintain a beneficial mucosal community. A better understanding of the complex nature of both the microbial network and the host-secreted glycans could aid in the design of nutritional intervention for health improvement. To this end, innovative avenues using novel probiotic strains (key species including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and butyrate-producing Clostridium), prebiotics (HMOS in early nutrition) and microbiota-targeted nutrients (iron and vitamin B12) deem promising.","The molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented and it is shown that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae."
