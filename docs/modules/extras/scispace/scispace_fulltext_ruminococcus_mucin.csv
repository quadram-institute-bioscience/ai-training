The species Ruminococcus gnavus is present in the digestive tract of ≥90% of humans and has been implicated in gut-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Here we analysed the ability of two R. gnavus human strains, E1 and ATCC 29149, to utilize host glycans. We showed that although both strains could assimilate mucin monosaccharides, only R. gnavus ATCC 29149 was able to grow on mucin as a sole carbon source. Comparative genomic analysis of the two R. gnavus strains highlighted potential clusters and glycoside hydrolases (GHs) responsible for the breakdown and utilization of mucin-derived glycans. Transcriptomic and functional activity assays confirmed the importance of specific GH33 sialidase, and GH29 and GH95 fucosidases in the mucin utilisation pathway. Notably, we uncovered a novel pathway by which R. gnavus ATCC 29149 utilises sialic acid from sialylated substrates. Our results also demonstrated the ability of R. gnavus ATCC 29149 to produce propanol and propionate as the end products of metabolism when grown on mucin and fucosylated glycans. These new findings provide molecular insights into the strain-specificity of R. gnavus adaptation to the gut environment advancing our understanding of the role of gut commensals in health and disease.","Title: Utilisation of Mucin Glycans by the Human Gut Symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus Is Strain-Dependent Authors: Emmanuelle H Crost,Louise E Tailford,Gwenaelle Le Gall,Michel Fons,Bernard Henrissat,Nathalie Juge (Corresponding Author)"

Several studies using both bacterial culture techniques and bio-molecular methods revealed that the amniotic cavity harbors microorganisms and, among them, uncultivated and uncharacterized taxa. The aim of the present PhD thesis was to evaluate the composition of some neglected populations inhabiting the infant gut microbiota until the second year of life. The PhD thesis is composed of three main chapters related to the presence of hydrogenotrophic populations, the occurrence of the Lachnospiraceae family in healthy subjects before the second year and the possible linkage between methanogens and diet in a piglet’s model. PCR-DGGE, the quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the Illumina deep sequencing have been the prevalent molecular techniques used in this work. Main conclusions obtained from these studies were mainly linked to the need of new primer sets that better describe the ecological complexity of the gut microbial community. This ambitious objective will be reached when it is possible to properly identify and quantify less represented bacterial populations within the infant gut ecosystem.","mode.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used as a first detection step and data were confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Here, we focused on two major human gut symbionts, the mucin-degrader Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149, and R. bromii L2-63, a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch (RS) in human colon. Using anaerobic individual and co-cultures of R. bromii and R. gnavus grown on mucin or starch as sole carbon source, we showed that starch degradation by R. bromii supported the growth of R. gnavus whereas R. bromii did not benefit from mucin degradation by R. gnavus. Further we analyzed the growth (quantitative PCR), metabolite production (1H NMR analysis), and bacterial transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) of R. bromii cultured with RS or soluble starch (SS) in the presence or absence of R. gnavus. In co-culture fermentations on starch, 1H NMR analysis showed that R. gnavus benefits from transient glucose and malto-oligosaccharides released by R. bromii upon starch degradation, producing acetate, formate, and lactate as main fermentation end-products. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) on starch (SS and RS) showed that the presence of R. bromii induced changes in R. gnavus transcriptional response of genes encoding several maltose transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism such as maltose phosphorylase, in line with the ability of R. gnavus to utilize R. bromii starch degradation products. In the RS co-culture, R. bromii showed a significant increase in the induction of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes and a decrease of vitamin B12 (VitB12)-dependent methionine biosynthesis as compared to the mono-culture, suggesting that Trp and VitB12 availability become limited in the presence of R. gnavus. Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R. gnavus population inhabiting the mucus niche may be modulated by the supply of non-digestible carbohydrates reaching the colon such as RS.","Title: Mechanistic Insights Into the Cross-Feeding of Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus bromii on Host and Dietary Carbohydrates Authors: Nathalie Juge (Corresponding Author),Emmanuelle H Crost,Gwenaelle Le Gall,Jenny A Laverde-Gomez,Indrani Mukhopadhya,Harry J Flint Keywords: cross-feeding, gut bacteria, Ruminococcus, mucin, resistant starch Padj, adjusted p-value, RS, resistant starch, SS, soluble starch"

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut microbiota in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.","Title: mucus-foraging Ruminococcus gnavus unravels mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to the gut Authors: Andrew Bell,Jason Brunt,Emmanuelle Crost,Laura Vaux,Ridvan Nepravishta,C David Owen,Dimitrios Latousakis,An Xiao,Wanqing Li,Xi Chen,Martin A Walsh,Jan Claesen,Jesus Angulo,Gavin H Thomas,Nathalie Juge (Corresponding Author) Keywords: Sialic acid, mucus, mucin, Ruminococcus gnavus, intramolecular trans-sialidase, 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, sialic acid transporter, carbohydrate binding, ABC transporter, sialic acid aldolase, colonisation, sialic acid metabolism"

Most of these microbial residents will grow within the mucus layer that overlies the gut epithelium and will act as the first line of defense against both commensal and invading microbes. This mucus is essentially formed by mucins, a family of highly glycosylated protein that are secreted by specialize cells in the gut. In this Review, we examine how commensal members of the microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use mucus to their advantage to promote their growth, develop biofilms and colonize the intestine. We also discuss how mucus-derived components act as nutrient and chemical cues for adaptation and pathogenesis of bacteria and how bacteria can influence the composition of the mucus layer.","a carbon and energy source for intestinal microbiota. A key nutritional aspect of the mucus layer for gut bacteria is its high polysaccharide content with up to 80% of the mucin biomass being composed of mostly O-linked glycans . Mucolytic Bacteria:
 A distinct subset of intestinal bacteria possesses the enzymatic activity, such as glycosidases, necessary for the degradation of mucin oligosaccharides, which can be further metabolized by resident microbiota . Indeed, various anaerobic bacteria species of gut microbiota, such as Akkermansia muciniphila , Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , Bifidobacterium bifidum , Bacteroides fragilis , Ruminococcus gnavus , and Ruminococcus torques  are now known as mucin-degrading specialists. These bacteria will use their specific enzymatic activities to release monosaccharides attached to the mucin glycoproteins. Some mucolytic bacteria, such as B. thetaiotaomicron, that possess an important variety of glycosidases, are better suited for the utilization of a wide range of glycans . To complete the degradation of mucins, a combination of enzymatic activity of several mucolytic bacteria is needed . Therefore, MUC2 glycans act as nutritional sources for bacteria that can utilize the mucus-derived sugars, but lack the enzymes necessary for cleaving sugar linkages . Commonly, several bacteria collaborate in a community and it has been shown that the sulfatase activity of some commensal bacteria on sulfomucin allows glycosidases to access and act on mucins . Released saccharides, such as N-acetyl-Dglucosamine (GlcNAc also called NAG), N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose, fucose and sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid also called NANA) can then be used by the degrader itself or by other resident bacteria . As example, commensal E. coli that are limited to growth on mono-or disaccharides, are unable to degrade the complex polysaccharides that constitute mucin  and therefore use such carbohydrate sources . Another example is vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus that can grow on mucin pre-digested with extracts from human stools, but not on purified mucin. This suggests that Enterococcus can benefit of the microbiota activity on mucin and uses released mucusderived products . In this way, mucolytic bacteria make mucus O-glycan derived products also available for other bacterial residents."

Colonic mucus consists of a loose outer layer and a dense epithelium-attached layer. The outer layer is inhabited by various representatives of the human gut microbiota (HGM). Glycans of the colonic mucus can be used by the HGM as a source of carbon and energy when dietary fibers are not sufficiently available. Both commensals and pathogens can utilize mucin glycans. Commensals are mostly involved in the cleavage of glycans, while pathogens mostly utilize monosaccharides released by commensals. This HGM-derived degradation of the mucus layer increases pathogen susceptibility and causes many other health disorders. Here, we analyzed 397 individual HGM genomes to identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides. Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, which significantly higher than a previous estimation. (ii) Genes for the catabolism of derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (iii) Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of monosaccharide transporters. (iv) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes may be involved in potential feeding pathways for the monosaccharides derived from cleaved mucin glycans. (v) The analyzed genomes demonstrated different abilities to degrade known mucin glycans. Generally, the ability to degrade at least one type of mucin glycan was predicted for 81% of the analyzed genomes. (vi) Eighty-two percent of the analyzed genomes can form mutualistic pairs that are able to degrade mucin glycans and are not degradable by any of the paired organisms alone. Taken together, these findings provide further insight into the inter-microbial communications of the HGM as well as into host-HGM interactions.","involved in the degradation of mucin glycans are perfect candidates to be tested for associations with health and disease. Thus, the fifth future direction is an analysis of the presence or absence of the analyzed genes in health and disease HGM metagenomes. Concluding Remarks and Future Plans:
 Computational modeling of metabolism ) may be used for elucidation of mucin glycan degradation by HGM organisms. Previously, genome-based models have been published for single representatives of the HGM  as well as for whole HGM communities . Additionally, computational models for human metabolism are also available , and host-microbial metabolic interactions have been modeled . Thus, the final future direction is to update the existing HGM and host-HGM metabolic models of reactions for all the pathways reconstructed in this study. Such an update would improve the existing models and would improve our understanding of the interaction between humans and their microbiome. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

They are associated with perturbation of the intestinal microbiota, and with alteration and crossing of the mucus barrier by the commensal bacteria that feed on it. In the process of mucus catabolism and invasion by gut bacteria, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play a critical role since mucus is mainly made up by O- and N-glycans. Moreover, the occurrence of IBD seems to be associated with low-fiber diets. Conversely, supplementation with oligosaccharides, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are structurally similar to intestinal mucins and could thus compete with them towards bacterial mucus-degrading CAZymes, has been suggested to prevent inflammation. In this mini-review, we will establish the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens, with a particular focus on the present technological opportunities available to further the discovery of mucus-degrading CAZymes within the entire gut microbiome, by coupling microfluidics with metagenomics and culturomics. Finally, we will discuss the challenges to overcome to better assess how CAZymes targeting specific functional oligosaccharides could be involved in the modulation of the mucus-driven cross-talk between gut bacteria and their host in the context of IBD. ","resistance to microbial degradation . It should be emphasized that the mucin O-glycans vary enormously along the intestinal tract and between species (Table ), compelling researchers in the area to take greater care when studying bacteria and mucin from the same niche. Identification and characterization of O-mucin degrading CAZymes:
 Several comparative genomic analyses have attempted to determine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota , and there have been efforts to couple these data with transcriptomic, proteomic, genetic and biochemical studies in order to understand mucin catabolic pathways. One of the earliest and most studied commensal bacteria is B. thetaiotaomicron, which is one of the richest human bacteria in glycan-degrading enzymes . In 2008, Martens and his team performed whole-genome transcriptional profiling and genetic tests to define the mechanisms underlying host glycan foraging in vivo (mice) and in vitro . Mucin O-glycans are the principal substrate foraged in vivo and 16 PULs were identified with probable specificities for O-glycans. Recently, two of these PULs were characterized highlighting the major role of GH16 enzymes  and sulfatases . Growth assays on mucins combined with transcriptomic analyses were also performed on other Bacteroidota such as B. fragilis  and B. massiliensis . Similar studies were performed on the mucin degraders A. muciniphila  (Verrucomicrobia), R. gnavus  (Firmicutes) and Bifidobacterium bifidum  (Actinobacteria).

 Em virtude de sua ampla utilização, diversas pesquisas tem sido desenvolvidas com o intuito de se estabelecer padrões apropriados e uniformizar a técnica in situ, visando a obtenção de repetibilidade aceitável dos resultados, como a porosidade do tecido, o tamanho de partícula, a quantidade de amostra, a lavagem dos sacos, entre outros. Degradabilidade ruminal:
 Alguns autores têm reportado que, a maior utilização dessa técnica pode estar ligada à rápida e fácil execução e ao fato de requerer pequena quantidade de amostra de alimento, além de possibilitar sua exposição com o ambiente ruminal. A técnica in situ, apesar de ter sido inicialmente usada para avaliação da degradabilidade da proteína, tem sido recomendada para avaliação de forragens, quanto ao desaparecimento da matéria seca e dos constituintes fibrosos .

We describe the design and optimization of this Raman-activated cell-sorting approach, illustrate its operation with four model bacteria (two intestinal, one soil and one marine) and demonstrate its high sorting accuracy (98.3 ± 1.7%), throughput (200–500 cells h−1; 3.3–8.3 cells min−1) and compatibility with cultivation. Application of this sorting approach for the metagenomic characterization of bacteria involved in mucin degradation in the mouse colon revealed a diverse consortium of bacteria, including several members of the underexplored family Muribaculaceae, highlighting both the complexity of this niche and the potential of Raman-activated cell sorting for identifying key players in targeted processes. Here, the authors developed an automated, high-throughput method for the sorting of single live cells based on their functional phenotype for downstream genomics or cultivation.

Identification of mucin utilizers:
 The RACS platform is highly versatile in its potential applications. It enables direct access to the genomes of microbes from complex microbial communities that respond metabolically to substrate additions or changes in other environmental conditions of interest. In this study the RACS platform was applied to investigate mucin degradation by members of the mouse colon microbiota. Mucin is a highly-glycosylated protein secreted by the mammalian colon that acts as an important barrier between the intestinal tissue and the microbiota, but which is also used as a nutrient source by gut bacteria  . Mucin degradation, mediated by the secretion of enzymes such as neuraminidases, α-and β-galactosidases, N-acetylglucosaminidases, Lfucosidades and β-N-hexosaminidases, is thought to be confined to a small group of specialized organisms  . Though genes involved in the partial or complete degradation of mucin are present in the genomes of a large fraction of gut inhabitants  , only a small fraction of genes in the microbiota are transcribed in vivo  , and it therefore remains unclear how broad the mucin degradation guild is in situ. Our results suggest that mucin degradation is a process mediated by a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria, though primary degraders belong largely to the Bacteroidetes (Fig. ). Interestingly, there appears to be specialization within the mucin-stimulated community, with only a small subset of species encoding enzymes necessary to cleave the terminal sialic acid and sulfate residues from the mucin Oglycans (Fig. ; enzymes EC 3.1.6.14 and EC 3.2.1.18). Sialylated and sulfated glycans are abundant in mouse colon mucins  , and therefore sialidases and mucin-desulfating sulfatases provide bacteria access to a fraction of mucin glycans inaccessible to the majority of potential mucin degraders. Organisms belonging to the family Muribaculaceae (Fig. ; Identification of mucin utilizers:
 Muribaculaceae bacterium MAG RACS_021 and Muribaculaceae bacterium MAG RACS_016) provide examples with this capacity. Members of the family Muribaculaceae are found in the guts of homoeothermic animals where they are thought to play an important role in modulating the host's health  . Previously, insights about the role and niche occupied by these abundant components of the mouse gut microbiota were based solely on genomic analyses or in vitro phenotypic characterization of a single isolate  . Here we have shown that members of this important family are stimulated by mucin, with at least two being part of a bacterial ""elite"" that can degrade nearly all of the O-glycans that constitute the mucus layer."

In particular, they are important in ruminants where they digest a wide range of plant cell wall polysaccharides. For example, Ruminococcus albus 7 is a primary cellulose degrader that produces acetate usable by its bovine host. Moreover, it is one of the few organisms that ferments cellulose to form ethanol at mesophilic temperatures in vitro. The mechanism of cellulose degradation by R. albus 7 is not well-defined and is thought to involve pilin-like proteins, unique carbohydrate-binding domains, a glycocalyx, and cellulosomes. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics, fermentation analyses, and transcriptomics to further clarify the cellulolytic and fermentative potential of R. albus 7. A comparison of the R. albus 7 genome sequence against the genome sequences of related bacteria that either encode or do not encode cellulosomes revealed that R. albus 7 does not encode for most canonical cellulosomal components. Fermentation analysis of R. albus 7 revealed the ability to produce ethanol and acetate on a wide range of fibrous substrates in vitro. Global transcriptomic analysis of R. albus 7 grown at identical dilution rates on cellulose and cellobiose in a chemostat showed that this bacterium, when growing on cellulose, utilizes a carbohydrate-degrading strategy that involves increased transcription of the rare carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) family 37 domain and the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. Our data suggest that R. albus 7 does not use canonical cellulosomal components to degrade cellulose, but rather up-regulates the expression of CBM37-containing enzymes and tryptophan biosynthesis. This study contributes to a revised model of carbohydrate degradation by this key member of the rumen ecosystem.","Title: Unique aspects of fiber degradation by the ruminal ethanologen Ruminococcus albus 7 revealed by physiological and transcriptomic analysis Authors: Melissa R Christopherson,John A Dawson,David M Stevenson,Andrew C Cunningham,Shanti Bramhacharya,Paul J Weimer,Christina Kendziorski,Garret Suen (Corresponding Author) Keywords: Ruminococcus albus, Cellulose utilization, Ethanol production"

Dynamic modeling approaches are best suited to the prediction of more nuanced responses in rumen metabolism, and represent the dynamics of the interactions between substrates and micro-organisms and inter-microbial interactions. The concepts of dynamics are discussed for the case of rumen starch digestion as influenced by starch intake rate and frequency of feed intake, and for the case of fermentation of fiber in the large intestine. Adding representations of new functional classes of micro-organisms (i.e., with new characteristics from the perspective of whole rumen function) in rumen models only delivers new insights if complemented by the dynamics of their interactions with other functional classes. Rumen fermentation conditions have to be represented due to their profound impact on the dynamics of substrate degradation and microbial metabolism. Although the importance of rumen pH is generally acknowledged, more emphasis is needed on predicting its variation as well as variation in the processes that underlie rumen fluid dynamics. The rumen wall has an important role in adapting to rapid changes in the rumen environment, clearing of volatile fatty acids (VFA), and maintaining rumen pH within limits. Dynamics of rumen wall epithelia and their role in VFA absorption needs to be better represented in models that aim to predict rumen responses across nutritional or physiological states. For a detailed prediction of rumen N balance there is merit in a dynamic modeling approach compared to the static approaches adopted in current protein evaluation systems. Improvement is needed on previous attempts to predict rumen VFA profiles, and this should be pursued by introducing factors that relate more to microbial metabolism. For rumen model construction, data on rumen microbiomes are preferably coupled with knowledge consolidated in rumen models instead of relying on correlations with rather general aspects of treatment or animal. This helps to prevent the disregard of basic principles and underlying mechanisms of whole rumen function.","aspects that have been incorporated in the various rumen models reported in literature include effective fiber, peptides, distribution of particles, fats and fatty acids, and sulfate (review , which have their own merit when aiming to explain rumen response to related factors. Classes of Microbial Function:
 A reason to introduce more detail on microbial activity into future rumen models, instead of representing a single type of micro-organism, might be the different niches that different species or classes of micro-organisms occupy. Another reason might be the differences in metabolic characteristics and growth capacity of micro-organisms, instead of making generic assumptions about amylolytic bacteria, fibrolytic bacteria and protozoa. Also differences in the sensitivity of microbial activity to conditions in the rumen environment instead treating as fully independent, might be a reason. Currently, we are unaware of modeling efforts or new approaches to further distinguish microbial classes in order to increase understanding of whole rumen function. Although new molecular techniques in principle enable measurement up to the level of detail of the individual species or genus, such information would be particularly useful if it could be related to the functional aspects of rumen fermentation already represented in whole rumen models [i.e., rates of substrate degradation, microbial growth rates, formation rates of end-products of fermentation, and rumen fermentation conditions (fractional outflow rates, pH, and VFA)]. For example, effects of subclinical acidosis on the rumen microbiome have been observed by . Also  were able to establish clear relationships between the observed microbial profile and dietary treatment and acidotic challenge. Others, however, could not establish a relationship between observed rumen fermentation parameters (including severity of acidosis) and shifts in the rumen microbiome, and a large variation existed between individual animals and measurement periods . Having in vivo rumen measurements or data on microbial physiology alongside data from modern molecular techniques and the wealth of sequence-based information seems pivotal in relating such data to whole rumen function and using them to make progress in rumen modeling. A completely statistical approach can be adopted to relate this level of detailed information directly to observed rumen function without representing the underlying mechanisms. Although useful to mark the consequences of different rumen states, e.g., by deriving microbiome profiles marking a specific rumen (or even animal) state (Chaucheyras-Durand and Ossa, 2014), the challenge remains to go beyond a fully empirical approach  and use this information to contribute to concepts that can be applied to the rumen modeling approaches discussed herein (and vice versa)."

The main cause of nitrogen-(N)-containing emissions is the inadequate provision of N to ruminants, leading to an excess of ammonia in the rumen, which is subsequently excreted. Depending on the size and molecular structure, various bacterial, protozoal and fungal species are involved in the ruminal breakdown of nitrogenous compounds (NC). Decelerating ruminal NC degradation by controlling the abundance and activity of proteolytic and deaminating microorganisms, but without reducing cellulolytic processes, is a promising strategy to decrease N emissions along with increasing N utilization by ruminants. Different dietary options, including among others the treatment of feedstuffs with heat or the application of diverse feed additives, as well as vaccination against rumen microorganisms or their enzymes have been evaluated. Thereby, reduced productions of microbial metabolites, e.g. ammonia, and increased microbial N flows give evidence for an improved N retention. However, linkage between these findings and alterations in the rumen microbiota composition, particularly NC-degrading microbes, remains sparse and contradictory findings confound the exact evaluation of these manipulating strategies, thus emphasizing the need for comprehensive research. The demand for increased sustainability in ruminant livestock production requests to apply attention to microbial N utilization efficiency and this will require a better understanding of underlying metabolic processes as well as composition and interactions of ruminal NC-degrading microorganisms.","whereas M. elsdenii was unaffected and P. ruminicola increased . Actually, these shifts can be considered beneficial as they were accompanied by decreased ammonia concentration, deaminase activity and proportions of BCVFA in total volatile fatty acids. Ionophores:
 Altogether, the aforementioned findings suggest a general ability of ionophores to influence NC-degrading bacteria and underline their potential to reduce ruminal N wastage. Nonetheless, research on long-term application of ionophores should confirm lasting alterations in abundance and activity of NC-degrading rumen microbes. Probiotics:
 Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance  and are widely used in animal nutrition . Applying qPCR, 16S rDNA copies of Rb. amylophilus and Strep. bovis decreased in steers supplied daily with viable Saccharomyces cerevisiae I-1077 through rumen cannulas. 18S or 16S rDNA copies of total protozoa and Sel. ruminantium, in turn, increased due to the supplementation . Concerning N metabolism, proteolytic and peptidolytic activities of P. albensis, B. fibrisolvens and Strep. bovis decreased during in vitro incubation with viable S. cerevisiae I-1077 . However, despite various alterations on a microbiological level, other studies reported no improvements of the amount and AA composition of microbial N reaching the duodenum in dairy cows supplemented with live yeast culture of S. cerevisiae . Therefore, comprehensive studies evaluating the effects of S. cerevisiae on ruminal NC-degrading microorganisms are encouraged as probiotic effects seem to be strain-specific . Additionally, the combination of probiotics either with prebiotic substances, leading to so-called synbiotics , or with plant extracts (e.g. tannins) could enhance the effects in ruminants . Probiotics:
 A chance to inhibit AA catabolism through probiotics was indicated by Callaway et al. , who found that the L. lactis-derived bacteriocin nisin  suppressed deamination and the growth of Cl. aminophilum in vitro. Thus, supplying ruminants with bacteriocinproducing probiotics might particularly alter deamination, but studies on the identification of strains that inhibit growth  and activity of HAB are still pending. Because existing data  were only obtained from in vitro experiments, more efforts must be made to evaluate such mechanisms in vivo. However, various interactions with other microbes and the host as well as the general high complexity of the rumen microbiome could make it hardly possible to relate any measured effect to bacteriocins."

Mucus has exceptional properties including elasticity, changeable rheology and an ability to self-repair by re-annealing, and is therefore an ideal medium for trapping and immobilising pathogens and serving as a barrier to microbial infection. The ability to produce a functional surface mucosa was an important evolutionary step, which evolved first in the Cnidaria, which includes corals, and the Ctenophora. This allowed the exclusion of non-commensal microbes and the subsequent development of the mucus-lined digestive cavity seen in higher metazoans. The fundamental architecture of the constituent glycoprotein mucins is also evolutionarily conserved. Although an understanding of the biochemical interactions between bacteria and the mucus layer are important to the goal of developing new antimicrobial strategies, they remain relatively poorly understood. This review summarises the physicochemical properties and evolutionary importance of mucus, which make it so successful in the prevention of bacterial infection. In addition, the strategies developed by bacteria to counteract the mucus layer are also explored.","permeable to sperm cells. Further work is required to assess the efficacy of these molecules in reinforcing the mucus layer, to prevent infection, however this is a promising advance in the application of mucus and its constituent mucins to biomedicine. Bacterial colonisation of mucus:
 Mucin glycoproteins in cancer show modifications, both in mucin expression and their O-glycosylation profile.  For example, epithelial cancer cells and early epithelial premalignant lesions are known to express immature truncated glycans.  Cancer biomarker assays usually centre around detection of changes in expression and bio-distribution of products derived from cancer cells.  Therefore, new assays are being developed to detect specific cancer-associated glycoforms of mucins.  Jellyfish mucins have been described as potential candidates for manufacturing protective coatings, as they are non-toxic and can be harvested from all parts of the jellyfish.  In addition, it has been speculated that mucins could be used in future to coat implants.  More specifically, Muc5b mucin has been proposed as a useful indicator to track the occurrence and monitor treatment efficacy in ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome.  Mucus is also being explored as a composite material in hydrogels to cover wounds and prevent nosocomial infection following surgery.  However, as mucins form gels under low ionic strength and low pH, they are not compatible with the external wound environment, thus mucin hydrogels require reconstitution with other macromolecules such as methylcellulose, which act as an adjuvant to form a hybrid biopolymer. There are some limitations to the biotechnological use of mucus, which include the difficulty in harvesting this substance in large quantities without exploiting and detrimentally impacting natural populations.  Additionally, acquisition of mucins from the crude mucus on a commercial scale may require volatile toxic chemicals, which could compromise their use in biomedicine.  Despite this, Qniumucin has been investigated for its potential in the treatment of osteoarthritis  and has since entered clinical trials to establish its suitability for use in regeneration of artificial cartilage.  In addition, bioactive compounds are beginning to be isolated from catfish mucus, which could be used in wound healing, as they have an inhibitory effect on growth of clinically relevant pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, which is similar to that of gentamicin.  Progress in this area however, will rely on the development of methods that allow large yields of mucus to be obtained, and this is not yet possible."

The collection had a series of analyses to assess binding potential for the selection of new probiotic candidates.

A low-fiber diet has been linked to lower bacterial diversity, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and promotion of mucosal pathogens. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are important enzymes involved in the bacterial catabolism of fiber into short-chain fatty acids. However, the GH involved in glycan breakdown (adhesion, hydrolysis, and fermentation) are organized in polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) with complex modularity. Our goal was to explore how the capacity of strains, from the Bacteroidetes phylum, to grow on fiber could be predicted from their genome sequences. We designed an in silico pipeline called FiberGrowth and independently validated it for seven different fibers, on 28 genomes from Bacteroidetes-type strains. To do so, we compared the existing GH annotation tools and built PUL models by using published growth and gene expression data. FiberGrowth's prediction performance in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) strongly depended on available data and fiber: arabinoxylan (TPR: 0.89 and FPR: 0), inulin (0.95 and 0.33), heparin (0.8 and 0.22) laminarin (0.38 and 0.17), levan (0.3 and 0.06), mucus (0.13 and 0.38), and starch (0.73 and 0.41). Being able to better predict fiber breakdown by bacterial strains would help to understand their impact on human nutrition and health. Assuming further gene expression experiment along with discoveries on structural analysis, we hope computational tools like FiberGrowth will help researchers prioritize and design in vitro experiments.","genes typically reported and used our model. It has been recently demonstrated that in Ruminococcus bromii L2-63 a cell surface amylosome and sporulation capacity exist for starch breakdown in strains from the human and rumen microbiota . DISCUSSION:
 Laminarin is also a storage glucan and the growth prediction was low. The performance was similar to the one for starch, despite a very different situation: our PUL model was inadequate since, based on the methodology and annotation, using GH3 and GH16, we might not have found an appropriate marker GH. However, a seven-gene PUL has been described for Bacteroides uniformis, which includes CBM6/GH3, GH158, and GH16.  reported that laminarin modulated the microbiome and increased propionate and butyrate in fermenters, pointing toward an effect on not only Bacteroidetes but also Firmicutes. Furthermore, it modulated mucus composition in rats' gastrointestinal tract . It was recently shown by another research group ) that an addition of laminarin into digesters increased Lachnospiraceae, compared to fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and cellulose. The mucin model led to the lowest prediction performance. Interestingly seven out of the eight non-Bacteroides genomes led to a false prediction. It was built using PULDB and included 11 genes, but several key GH involved in mucin breakdown were not accounted for. The PUL model was based on transcriptomics data, and because of the complexity of mucin, the GH genes over-expressed at this time point were limited. Another issue is cDNA annotation. For instance, one of the main causes of misannotation of the fuc genes is their similarity to the genes for rhamnose utilization. Both the FucK and RhaB proteins belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases (Pfam: PF02782). DISCUSSION:
 Mucin used in experiments is very frequently pig gastric mucin type III. However, mucin composition depends upon the individual and the GI tract segment, and its complexity has only recently been acknowledged. Mucin is at a crossroad between dietary substrates and human secretion. Indeed, using droplet microfluidics, we recently demonstrated and characterized a new GH enzyme, active on human gangliosides, with similar structure to human mucin and milk oligosides and overrepresented in IBD patients' metagenomes . The mucin composition and degradation pathways still remain to be elucidated."

Ottman The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a complex community of micro-organisms, the gut microbiota. The majority of these are bacteria, which perform various functions involved in host energy metabolism and immune system stimulation. The field of gut microbiology is continuously expanding as novel species are isolated and high-throughput techniques are developed. The research focus is shifting from DNA-based techniques, looking at microbial community composition, to techniques relying on analysis of RNA and proteins, which reveal more about the activity and functionality of the microbiota. The mucosa-associated microbiota forms a distinct population in the gut, and is influenced by the close proximity of the epithelial layer and nutrients present in the mucus layer. One of the key players in this community is the mucus degrader Akkermansia muciniphila. This Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium can use mucin, the main component of mucus, as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. A. muciniphila belongs to the phylum Verrucomicrobia and is present in the majority of humans, starting from early life. Interestingly, the levels of A. muciniphila are negatively correlated with several disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases and diabetes. A. muciniphila lives in a symbiosis with its host, harvesting energy from mucin; whether the relationship is mutualistic, and thereby also beneficial to the host, remains to be discovered. In this thesis, the ability of A. muciniphila to utilize the host-derived glycans mucin and human milk oligosaccharides was studied in detail. In addition, the host-bacterial interactions were examined by immunological assays, focusing especially on the effect of A. muciniphila outer membrane proteins on host immune response. The genome of A. muciniphila encodes numerous enzymes involved in mucin degradation. Transcriptome analysis comparing the gene expression of A. muciniphila grown on mucin or the non-mucin sugar glucose confirmed the activity of these genes and revealed most of them to be upregulated in the presence of mucin. This was also confirmed by a proteome analysis, reinforcing the adaptation of A. muciniphila to the mucosal environment. A genome-based metabolic model was constructed to test amino acid auxotrophy, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar-degrading capacities of A. muciniphila. The model predicted A. muciniphila to be able to synthesize all the essential amino acids, with the exception of threonine, which was added to the mucin-free medium designed to test A. muciniphila growth on single sugars. A. muciniphila was able to individually metabolize all the main monomeric sugars present in mucin, albeit with limited efficiency in comparison to mucin. As mucin shares structural similarities with human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which stimulate the bacterial community colonizing the gut in early life, growth of A. muciniphila on human milk and its components was tested. A. muciniphila showed metabolic activity on human milk and one of the HMOs, 2’-fucosyllactose. Comparison of A. muciniphila activity during growth on human milk or mucin revealed that the expression of genes involved in mucin degradation was similar for both experimental conditions, suggesting that A. muciniphila might be capable of also using the corresponding gene products for utilization of human milk glycans. The capacity to survive in the early life environment by degrading and consuming human milk components would be beneficial for A. muciniphila during initial colonization before reaching the mucosal layer in the intestine. Several mouse studies have indicated that A. muciniphila is able to modulate the host immune system, possibly to the benefit of the host, but not much is known about its immunological mechanism of action. The cell envelope structures of bacteria can have a big influence on their immunostimulatory capacities, and therefore the outer membrane (OM) proteome of A. muciniphila was characterized. The membrane structure of A. muciniphila is also of interest because it belongs to the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae superphylum, which contains bacteria with features that differentiate them from classical Gram-negative bacteria, including a complex endomembrane system. Mass spectrometry data, coupled with bioinformatics analysis, revealed the presence of highly abundant OM proteins involved in secretion, transport and biogenesis of the Gram-negative membranes, as well as proteins predicted to take part in formation of the fimbriae-like structures observed in A. muciniphila by electron microscopy. Live A. muciniphila and the identified OM proteins induced production of a wide range of cytokines and activated the intestinal Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Moreover, a 30 kDa protein that was predicted to form a part of the fimbriae, increased transepithelial resistance, indicating it may be involved in improving gut barrier function. Based on the evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies, A. muciniphila is a promising candidate for a next-generation probiotic. However, further confirmation of causal relationships between disease development and presence of this species in the gut is required. The findings of this thesis provide valuable insight into the bacterial lifestyle and host interactions of the gut symbiont A. muciniphila.","covalently bound to the oligosaccharide chains , and the sulfatases expressed by A. muciniphila most likely desulfate this to increase the susceptibility of the mucin to degradation by other mucin-degrading enzymes . Transcriptomic and proteomic response to A. muciniphila growth on mucin and glucose:
 Out of all the significantly differentially expressed hypothetical proteins, almost 70 % were upregulated in the glucose cultures on both transcriptome and proteome level. More insight on the adaption of A. muciniphila to glucose could be gained by further research on the functions of these proteins. Transcriptomic and proteomic response to A. muciniphila growth on mucin and glucose:
 In conclusion, the upregulation of genes and proteins involved in mucin degradation in A. muciniphila grown on mucin is consistent with the adaptation of A. muciniphila to this environment. Besides the identified glucokinase (Amuc_1094), it was more challenging to pin down genes specific to the glucose environment. As the growth rate and yield of A. muciniphila are higher during growth on mucin than on glucose, many of the changes in gene expression may be involved in a global response to fast growth, rather than the specific carbon source.

The importance of adequately stating the objective of the model in relation to the level of representation of rumen processes is stressed. No model yet exists which can accurately simulate rumen metabolism in all circumstances. A number of issues related to rumen modelling require further research. The sound representation of rumen microbial metabolism is essential. Aspects of microbial metabolism which deserve further attention include microbial distribution within the rumen, microbial interactions, and chemical composition of microbial matter. The representation of outflow from the rumen requires a more mechanistic approach, which should adequately cover continuous as well as discontinuous feeding regimes. Finally, the representation of VFA production is identified as being inadequate, and future attempts to improve prediction of VFA profile should include provisions for the effect of amount and rate of substrate degradation and microbial species preferences on type of VFA produced.","microbial cell composition, fractional growth rate, and microbial turnover (Hespell and Bryant, 1979). Microbial metabolism: Representation of these factors in rumen models will be described subsequently, except for microbial turnover which has been discussed previously. Microbial metabolism:
 The overall use of substrates by growing microbes can be divided into substrate utilization for maintenance and for mass increase. In most models, maintenance requirements have to be met before growth can occur. Thus, the production of microbial matter is calculated as: Microbial metabolism:
 where P mi (g microbial DM/h) is the amount of microbial matter synthesized, Y&dquo;, ax (g microbial DM/g substrate) the maximum cell yield, U s (g substrate/h) the utilization of substrate by microbes, M e (g substrate/g microbial DM/h) the maintenance coefficient, and O mi (g microbial DM) the microbial biomass in the rumen. This relationship can be rearranged to give the Pirt (1965) double reciprocal equation (Figure ), which is widely used in microbiology: Microbial metabolism:
 where Y (= P M; /U s ; g microbial DM/g substrate) is the cell yield and 1A (P M¡ !Q Mi ; /h) the fractional growth rate. The M e for rumen microbes as derived by Isaacson et al (1975) (0.05 g glucose/g microbial DM/h) is frequently applied in rumen models. M e varies with bacterial species and growth conditions (Hespell and Bryant, 1979). In the Cornell model, M e for bacteria degrading SC and NSC is 0.05 and 0.15 g carbohydrate/g microbial DM/h, respectively. Depending upon dietary conditions, limitations on the availability of nutrients including ammonia, amino acids or peptides can occur, which results in a higher degree of energetic uncoupling and consequently raised M e value (Hespell and  Bryant, 1979). This aspect was represented in the models of Baldwin et al (1987b) and Danfasr (1990) (but reducing Yma! in stead of increasing M e ), Dijkstra et al (1992), and  Dijkstra (1994a)."

Reflecting its importance, the HGM is sometimes referred to as an 'organ' as it performs functions analogous to systemic tissues within the human host. The major nutrients available to the HGM are host and dietary complex carbohydrates. To utilise these nutrient sources, the HGM has developed elaborate, variable and sophisticated systems for the sensing, capture and utilisation of these glycans. Understanding nutrient acquisition by the HGM can thus provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics of this ecosystem, and how it impacts human health. Dietary nutrient sources include a wide variety of simple and complex plant and animal-derived glycans most of which are not degraded by enzymes in the digestive tract of the host. Here we review how various adaptive mechanisms that operate across the major phyla of the HGM contribute to glycan utilisation, focusing on the most complex carbohydrates presented to this ecosystem.","E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and C. dif cile could bene t from mucin cross-feeding interactions by scavenging sialic acids released by B. thetaiotaomicron . Mucin O-glycan metabolism:
 The Firmicutes Ruminococcus gnavus and R. torques also produce mucin-degrading enzymes. A transcriptomic study on R. gnavus revealed the induction of several mucin-degrading GH families containing, for example, sialidases (GH33), βgalactosidases (GH2), fucosidases (GH95) and sialic acid utilisation genes . As with the Bacteroidetes, further biochemical characterisation of the members of the relevant GH families in these organisms is required to better understand the mechanism of mucin use by the Firmicutes and hence their role in host-microbial interactions at the mucus interface. Although lactobacilli contain surface mucin-binding proteins , and are thus able to populate the mucus layer, there is no evidence that these bacteria are able to degrade these heavily glycosylated proteins . Although GH33 sialidases and a limited number of other putative mucin-degrading enzymes are present in P. vulgaris CYPV1 and Klebsiella oxytoca JKo3 (Fig. ), in general proteobacterial genomes lack the genetic capacity to degrade these mammalian glycans. Hence, as suggested earlier, this phylum relies on monosaccharides generated by ef cient mucin-degrading HGM species. Mucin O-glycan metabolism:
 To conclude, considering the importance of host-microbial interactions at the mucin interface, detailed studies on the Actinobacteria (mainly Bi dobacteria) need to be extended to other major phyla represented in the HGM for a better understanding of mucin-based host-HGM interactions. Mucin degradation studies should also focus on A. muciniphila, whose genome encodes diverse mucinase enzyme families (Fig. ). Further examination of mucin based cross-feeding interactions in the HGM could also shed new light into the collective use of mucindegrading capacity within this ecosystem."

Pouchitis develops in former patients with UC after total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (“pouch surgery”) and is characterized by inflammation of the previously normal small intestine comprising the pouch. It has been extensively shown that broad taxonomic and functional alterations (“dysbiosis”) occur in the gut microbiome of patients with IBD. However, the extent to which microbial dysbiosis in pouchitis resembles that of CD or UC has not been investigated in-depth, and the pathogenesis of pouchitis largely remains unknown. Results In this study we collected 250 fecal metagenomes from 75 patients with a pouch, including both non-inflamed (normal pouch) and inflamed (pouchitis) phenotypes, and compared them to publicly available metagenomes of patients with CD (n=88), and UC (n=76), as well as healthy controls (n=56). Patients with pouchitis presented the highest level of dysbiosis compared to other IBD phenotypes based on species, metabolic pathways and enzyme profiles, and their level of dysbiosis was correlated with intestinal inflammation. In patients with pouchitis, the microbiome mucin degradation potential was lower, but was accompanied by an enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus strains encoding specific mucin-degrading glycoside hydrolases, which might be pro-inflammatory. Butyrate and secondary bile acids producers were decreased in all IBD phenotypes and were especially low in pouchitis. Butyrate synthesis genes were positively correlated with total dietary fiber intake. Patients with pouchitis harbored more facultative anaerobic bacteria encoding enzymes involved in oxidative stress response, suggesting high oxidative stress during pouch inflammation. Finally, we have developed enzymes-based classifiers that can distinguish between patients with a normal pouch and pouchitis with an area under the curve of 0.91. Conclusions We propose that the non-inflamed pouch is already dysbiotic (function- and species-wise) and microbially is more similar to CD than to UC. Our study reveals microbial functions that underlie the pathogenesis of pouchitis and suggests bacterial groups and functions that could be targeted for nutritional intervention to attenuate or prevent small intestinal inflammation present in pouchitis and CD.","Alpha-Nacetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.50), Alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) and Beta-Nacetylhexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52). Mucin degradation glycoside hydrolases (GH) enzymes analysis:
 To analyze the specific GH of Ruminococcus gnavus, GH29 (Alpha-L-fucosidase), GH95 (glycoside hydrolase family 95) and GH33 (Exo-alpha-sialidase) protein sequences of Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149 strain JCM6515 were downloaded from Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZY) database . Three single-copy housekeeping genes (DNA gyrase subunit A [gyrA], recombinase A [recA], and 50S ribosomal protein L2 [rplB]) of the same R. gnavus strain were downloaded as well. These GH and the housekeeping genes were used to build a reference database for similarity search as mentioned previously. For GH, sequence similarity matches of ≥ 90% and ≥ 25 amino acids alignment length were used, and for housekeeping genes, sequence similarity matches were increased to ≥ 97% to count only closely related species. Read counts were normalized by the corresponding gene length, and the percentage of R. gnavus strains encoding GH29, GH95 and GH33 were calculated by dividing each GH by the mean abundance of gyrA, recA, and rplB. As gyrA recruited the highest number of reads even after gene-length normalization, we used only gyrA for the final calculation. Samples with fewer than 5 gyrA reads of R. gnavus were removed from the analysis. Statistical analysis:
 The Kruskal-Wallis H-test with Dunn's test for multiple comparisons correction (pairwise tests between phenotypes) was performed using kruskal.test and dunn.test functions in R package 'dunn.test'. Alpha-diversity (within-sample) was calculated with the Shannon diversity index using diversity function in R package 'vegan'. Beta-diversity (between-sample) was calculated with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (vegdist function in R package 'vegan') and visualized with principal coordinate analysis cmdscale function (classical multidimensional scaling) in R. Spearman rank correlation between the first axis of microbiome variation, Shannon diversity, and key functional genes and fecal calprotectin was performed using cor.test function in R. Statistical analysis:
 To calculate the proportion of variance explained by each tested variable on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (for species, pathways and enzymes), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test was performed using adonis function in the R package 'vegan'. The variables included disease phenotype, age, antibiotic use, fecal calprotectin, gender, disease activity, pouch phenotype and inter-subject variation (the last four variables were only available for the cohort of patients with a pouch and were fitted separately). The variance explained by each variable was calculated independently of other variables to avoid issues related to variable ordering."

browsing legumes, with 3 kg of fermented promoters (FP), were provided with 1.5 kg of lactobacilli per day as supplement (LAB). The grazing area was 20.9 ha. Another herd of 28 animals (514 ±14 kg), grazing on 18.5 ha, supplemented with 6 kg/d of a commercial concentrate with 160 g of commercial probioric (CP), was used. An amount of 8 commercial milks were sampled. The milk from the three treatments was weighed each week.
The average of production was 17 kg for LAB, of 14 kg/d in silvopastoril system (SP) and 16 kg in CP (P<0.05). The saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids showed differences in the three treatments (P<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega 3 and conjugated linoleic acid were 34%, 46% and 68% higher in CP, silvopastoral system and LAB compared to commercial milk (CM). Results have demonstrated that grazing diverse green fresh forages improve milk quality due to the increase of unsaturated fatty acids. The LAB allowed a decrease of biohydrogenation.
LAB and SP provided the milks with highest amount of omega 3.

 From the first decade of this century, modifications on the use of lactic bacteria in ruminants were added to the original works on ruminal fermentation . This demonstrated its effectiveness on digestibility of fibrous forages . The results of all these researches have had a significantly higher effect on fiber degradation in the rumen that has allowed the development of alternative management systems with or without LAB supplementation to improve product quality .

Bryden","10.1079/NRR19980014","https://scispace.com/pdf/perspectives-on-ruminant-nutrition-and-metabolism-i-1kb8wazzr5.pdf","Advances in knowledge of ruminant nutrition and metabolism during the second half of the twentieth century have been reviewed. Part I is concerned with metabolism in the rumen: Part II discusses utilization of nutrients absorbed from the rumen and lower tract to support growth and reproduction. The time frame was prompted by the crucial advances in ruminant physiology which arose from the work of Sir Jospeh Barcroft and his colleagues at Cambridge in the 1940s and 50s, and by the brilliant studies of Robert Hungate on rumen microbiology at much the same time.In reviewing the growth of knowledge of the role of bacteria, protozoa, fungi and bacteriophages in the rumen, outstanding developments have included the identification and characterization of fungi and the recognition that the utilization of polysaccharides in the rumen is accomplished by the sequential activities of consortia of rumen microorganisms. The role of protozoa is discussed in relation to the long standing debate on whether or not the removal of protozoa (defaunation) improves the efficiency of ruminant production. In relation to nitrogen (N) metabolism, the predation of bacteria by protozoa increases protein turnover in the rumen and reduces the efficiency of microbial protein production. This may account for the beneficial effects of defaunation where dietary N intakes are low and possibly rate limiting for growth and production.Current approaches to the measurement of rates of production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the rumen based on the mathematical modelling of isotope dilution data are outlined. The absorption of SCFA from the rumen and hindgut is primarily a passive permeation process.The role of microorganisms in N metabolism in the rumen has been discussed in relation to ammonia and urea interrelationships and to current inadequacies in the measurement of both protein degradation in the rumen and microbial protein synthesis. The growth of knowledge of digestion and absorption of dietary lipids has been reviewed with emphasis on the antimicrobial activity of lipids and the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. The protection of unsaturated dietary fats from ruminal biohydrogenation is an approach to the manipulation of the fatty acid composition of meat and dairy products.Discussion of the production of toxins in the rumen and the role of microorganisms in detoxification has focused on the metabolism of oxalate, nitrate, mycotoxins, saponins and the amino acid mimosine. Mimosine occurs in the tropical shrub leucaena, which is toxic to cattle in Australia but not in Hawaii. Tolerance to leucaena stems from the presence of a bacterium found in the rumen of Hawaiian cattle, which when transferred to Australian cattle survives and confers protection from mimosine. The genetic modification of rumen microorganisms to improve their capacity to ultilize nutrients or to detoxify antinutritive factors is an attractive strategy which has been pursued with outstanding success in the case of fluoroacetate. A common rumen bacterium has been genetically modified to express the enzyme fluoroacetate dehalogenase. The modified organism has been shown to survive in the rumen at metabolically significant levels and to confer substantial protection from fluoroacetate poisoning.","organism in peptide metabolism in the rumen makes it an obvious target for attempts to manipulate ruminal activity and indeed the effects of ionophores zyxwv are in part mediated via their effects on Prevotella ruminicola (see . Measurement of protein degradation in the rumen:
 The long recognized significance of the metabolic fate of dietary proteins has led to sustained interest in the development of methods for measuring rates zyx of ruminal degradation (see Bro- Perspectives on ruminant nutrition and metabolism zyxw 183 zy derick et zyxwvut af. 1991). Indeed, the most widely used feeding systems, the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (Sniffen et af. 1992; Chalupa zyxw & Sniffen, zyx 1994) and the U.K. Metabolizable Protein System  require estimates of dietary protein degradation in the rumen. The most widely used method was developed by 0rskov and his colleagues  and involves suspending the test protein in a nylon bag in the rumen. This in situ procedure, which has proved an effective method for comparing the relative degradability of different proteins, has severe limitations (see Broderick et af. 1991). The most important of these are the potential contamination of the sample with microbial protein and the loss of soluble proteins which may not be degraded. Measurement of protein degradation in the rumen:
 Efforts to measure directly the extent of dietary protein degradation and the amounts of microbial protein and other nitrogenous materials passing out of the rumen began in the 1960s."

In the colon, mucus covering the epithelium is critical to maintain a homeostatic relationship with the gut microbiota by harboring a microbial community at safe distance from the epithelium surface. The mucin glycans composing the mucus layer provide binding sites and a sustainable source of nutrients to the bacteria inhabiting the mucus niche. Access to these glycan chains requires a complement of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) produced by bacteria across the phyla constituting the human gut microbiota. Due to the increased recognition of the role of mucus-associated microbes in human health, how commensal bacteria breakdown and utilize host mucin glycans has become of increased interest and is reviewed here. This short review provides an overview of the strategies evolved by gut commensal bacteria to access this rich source of the nutrient with a focus on the GHs involved in mucin degradation.","niches are already occupied by commensal species , and the production of metabolites directly implicated in the communication of microbes with the host. The mucus-associated gut microbiota can also significantly affect the development of the host immune system as extensively reviewed . Mucin glycosylation and associated bacteria in the gut:
 Mucin glycans make up ∼80% of the molecular mass of mucins, the main structural component of mucus. Mucin-type O-glycosylation is initiated by a large family of polypeptide GalNAc transferases (ppGalNAc Ts) that add α-GalNAc to the Ser and Thr residues of peptides. Mucin glycosylation is characterized by a high degree of structural diversity which is based on three elements. The first is the type of core structure. There are eight mucin core structures in humans with structures 1-4 most commonly found in intestinal mucins . The second stage of glycan diversity is determined by the action of a range of glycosyltransferases that elongate the mucin core through the addition of galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and/or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues leading to linear or branched chains of up to 20 residues . The third element of diversity is conferred by the peripheral epitopes that are often fucosylated, sialylated or sulphated . Mucin glycosylation and associated bacteria in the gut:
 At the ecological level, the diversity of mucin glycans along the GI tract contributes to shape the structure and function of the gut microbiota. While the luminal microbiota may respond primarily to diet, the mucus-associated microbiota is influenced more directly by host-related factors. Importantly, the ability to utilize host mucin glycans as a carbon source gives bacteria a sustainable and consistent nutrient supply and a competitive advantage to colonize the mucus layer . As reviewed in , it is now established that mucin glycan degradation is widespread across the major phyla represented in the human gut microbiota. Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin glycan degradation specialist and, therefore, considered as a keystone member of the mucusassociated microbiota  while Bacteroidetes are viewed as general glycan degraders able to switch from dietary to host glycan metabolism due to their extensive array of carbohydrate-active enzymes . Actinobacteria, which are largely represented by Bifidobacteria in the human gut microbiota, are typically adapted to carbohydrates with a low degree of polymerization and mucin glycan metabolism strategy is similar to the Firmicutes . Consistent with this, the presence of mucins in in vitro fermentation models leads to an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes, Akkermansia and Lachnospiraceae species that are known mucin glycan degraders, whilst levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium decrease . In vivo, both chronic and intermittent fiber deficiency promotes enrichment of mucin glycan degrading bacteria in mouse models, leading to a significant increase in A. muciniphila and Bacteroides caccae species accompanied by a decrease of the fiber-degrading species ."

The present study was undertaken to determine the dif- ferential fate of the various types of mucins. Mucins from germ-free rats were incubated in vitro in the presence of whole caecal flora from the conventional rat. Neutral, acidic and acidic sulphated mucins were spectrophotometrically assayed over time upon anaerobic incubation. Sialylated mucins were more rapidly degraded (90 %) than the other two types after 1 h and almost completely within 4 h. Neutral and acidic sulphated mucins, with a 10-fold and 30-fold lower content than the sialylated fraction in the original substrate, were more slowly degraded and to a lesser extent within 4 h, (55 and 40 %, respectively). The method used in the present study made it possible to investigate the activity of gut bacteria towards the various types of mucins. The degradation of the three mucin types was not uniform, the highest rate and extent of degradation being observed for sialylated mucins. @ Inra/Elsevier, Paris","pro- tocol used to sediment bacteria before the assays led to a significant decrease of free mucin content (37 ± 5 %). This sugges- ted a very rapid adsorption of mucins of all types on the bacterial cell walls. DISCUSSION:
 The rapid degradation of mucin that we observed, particularly for sialylated mucin in 4 h, (nearly complete in 24 h in our pre- liminary study), must be related to the fact that mucins were incubated in the pre- sence of a whole caecal microbial flora from the conventional rat. This is in agree- ment with the earlier study of Hoskins and Zamcheck  who observed practically no mucin compounds left in the faeces of the conventional rats, while they are always present in the faeces of germ-free rodents. Since the composition of mucin and the mucinolytic bacterial activities vary between species, our experiments with total bacterial flora were probably closer to physiological conditions than pure culture experiments. However, the validity of transposing such in vitro data to in vivo conditions is open to question. DISCUSSION:
 Comparison of our results with pure culture studies reported in the literature is nevertheless interesting. Salyers et al. [23,  24 used very long incubation times (7 days). Oligosaccharide degradation from pig gastric mucin was associated with extracellular glycosidases produced by bacterial subpopulations [11]. Hill [9] used seve- ral mucinolytic bacterial isolates and incu- bation times of up to 5 days, and the hexose assays before and after incubation, showed variations, taking into account the origin of the mucin studied (pig gastric mucin or rabbit intestinal mucin). Varia- tions in the number of mucin-containing cells occur between rats depending on their microbial status (conventional rats or human flora associated rats). This was related to the specific activities of these flora [17, 25, 26]. DISCUSSION:
 In a more recent study, the role of human faecal bacteria, particularly mucin oligosaccharide-degrading strains, was analysed. The cleavage products of poly- DISCUSSION:
 saccharides were characterized and their potential role in nutritional support of lar- ger faecal bacterial populations demons- trated . Furthermore, Willis et al.  showed that batch culture incubation of pig gastric mucin with human faecal bac- teria produced an increase in sulphide that was not seen with incubation of other fermentable carbohydrates. A variety of microorganisms are able to ferment mucin, in addition to its hydrolysis products, and our results strongly suggest the implication of a consortium of microorganisms in vivo. DISCUSSION:
 The methodology used in the present study showed that the three mucin types were not degraded to a similar extent. Although the sialylated mucin was more abundant than the two other mucin classes, it was degraded more quickly. This can be related to the sialidase activity of the whole bacterial consortium. It would be of interest to determine whether the pre- ferential degradation of sialylated mucin by the caecal flora differs with dietary constraints or under pathological situa- tions."

Those antibiotic-induced alternations in microbial conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol might influence other results of cholesterol metabolism, such as serum cholesterol levels and development of atheromatous arterial disease . (Adapted from 144) Degradation of mucin:
 Mucin in the GI tract is produced by goblet cells in the surface and crypt epithelium and in glandular mucous cells arranged in acinar structures in the submucosa. Mucin consists of a peptide core with oligosaccharide side chains O-glycosidically bound. Mucin has several important physiological and patho-physiological roles. It acts as lubricant, as a barrier and stabiliser for the intestinal microclimate, and as a source of energy for the microflora. There is a growing evidence that alterations of mucin may be relevant in the pathophysiology of some intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, gastric and duodenal ulceration, colon adenocarcinoma, intestinal strangulation and mucus obstruction in cystic fibrosis . Degradation of mucin:
 GF rats excrete large amounts of mucin with their faeces, whereas CONV rats and healthy adult humans do not excrete mucin . Some strains belonging to the Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus genera (65) have been isolated and related to degrading mucin. Degradation of mucin:
 The complete degradation of mucin might require various glycosidases and peptidases, and it is possible that the degradation is a sequential action of bacterial strains . However, one Peptostreptococcus strain  has been shown to be without glycosidases, and still degrade mucin totally with its peptidases. A markedly altered establishment of mucin degradation has been reported earlier in adult ex-GF rats . A pronounced difference of priming the mucin degradation has been found between breast-fed and formula-fed children, probably partly depending upon diet and environment . These findings and also a spontaneous reestablishment of mucin degradation after antibiotic treatment in healthy human adults , confirm that mucin-degrading microbes are widely distributed in the environment. This subject is discussed in paper III. Degradation of mucin:
 Studies in rats have shown that bacitracin, clindamycin and vancomucin suppress degradation of mucin  and man . Degradation of tryptic activity, TA:
 Trypsin is chosen as a model for studying endogenously derived enzymes. It is excreted as a precursor, trypsinogen, from the pancreas, and activated in the small intestine, mainly by brush border enzymes . TA involves the net sum of processes such as the secretion of trypsinogen, the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin and the presence in the intestine of host-, microbial-and diet-derived compounds that inactivate or degrade trypsin. Faeces of GF rats contain large amounts of TA, whereas far less is found in their CONV counterparts ."

 The highly hydrated mucus gel overlaying the epithelial surfaces of the human body (e.g. respiratory, oral, gastrointestinal tracts) is a first line of defence against invading microorganisms, impurities, chemical (toxins), enzymatic and mechanical disruptions. Besides being a physical barrier it is also a matrix rich in host antimicrobial molecules (e.g. lysozyme, IgA, lactoferrin) . The mucus major components are the high molecular weight glycoprotein mucins, which are constituted by a protein core heavily decorated with carbohydrate polymers of varied nature and size. Living on mucins and the particular case of the mucin-degrading S. pneumoniae:
 The carbohydrates present in mucins provide alternative binding sites to bacterial adhesins and, hence enable bacteria to thrive evading interactions with the underlying epithelium . For example, the ability of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to persist in the human gut as recently been associated with the ability of a protein in the pilli to bind host mucins . Remarkably, mucins are also a valuable nutritional reservoir of carbon and energy sources particularly important in niches where free carbohydrates are limited, such as the nasopharynx or micro niches in the gastrointestinal tract, enabling bacterial survival and colonisation on these surfaces . Mucins are heavily O-glycosylated glycoproteins, generally composed of the monosaccharides Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and fucose (Fuc) , which carbohydrate content can reach up to 80% of the mucin molecular mass . Bacteria have evolved strategies to circumvent the mucin barrier and take advantage of this structure. Among others, those mechanisms encompass production of mucin-degrading enzymes that release carbohydrates from O-or N-linked oligosaccharide side chains (glycosidases) and proteins (proteases) that destabilize the mucus gel properties . Thus, the ability to utilise mucin depends, to great extent, on these activities."

 Se utilizaron dos vacas Holstein, secas y canuladas en el rumen, en un diseño de bloques al azar, con arreglo factorial 2 x 6. Los factores fueron harinas de granos de gandul (Cajanus cajan) y de mucuna (Stizolobium niveum) y seis tiempos de incubación en el rumen: 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 y 36 h, para estudiar la degradación ruminal de la materia seca (DMS) y la degradación ruminal efectiva de la proteína bruta (DEPB). Se utilizó el método de la bolsa de nailon, con tres montajes por tiempo de incubación y tres para cada una de las harinas estudiadas. Para estimar la DEPB, se utilizaron los resultados obtenidos a las 24 h de incubación y se asumieron constantes de velocidad de recambio ruminal entre 0.02 y 0.07 % h 1 . Hubo interacción (P < 0.05) entre los factores estudiados. La DMS alcanzó valores de 44.20 y 45.64 % a las tres horas para mucuna y gandul, respectivamente, y se incrementó (P < 0.05) con el tiempo de incubación hasta alcanzar 96.09 y 96.22 a las 36 h, en el mismo orden. La DEPB disminuyó (P < 0.05) a medida que se incrementó la constante de recambio ruminal, con valores de 68.92 y 68.39 para mucuna y gandul, respectivamente. Los resultados de este trabajo sugieren que la degradación efectiva de la proteína de los granos crudos de gandul y mucuna es menor que la informada para otros granos de leguminosas tropicales. Se recomienda continuar estudios relacionados con la composición nitrogenada de estos granos. R. González:

Despite their ubiquity, animal mucins are largely uncharacterized. Snails produce mucin proteins in their mucous for a wide array of biological functions, including microbial protection, adhesion and lubrication. Recently, snail mucins have also become a lucrative source of innovation with wide ranging applications across chemistry, biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine. Specifically, snail mucuses have been applied as skin care products, wound healing agents, surgical glues, and to combat gastric ulcers. Recent advances in integrated omics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, glycomic) technologies have improved the characterization of gastropod mucins, increasing the generation of novel biomaterials. This perspective describes the current research on secreted snail mucus, highlighting the potential of this biopolymer, and also outlines a research strategy to fulfill the unmet need of examining the hierarchical structures that lead to the enormous biological and chemical diversity of snail mucus genes.","of the molecule within the mucin column indicated high drug-mucin interaction, which is correlated to delayed bioavailability in vivo . This adds another dimension to evaluate medications used in specific diseases that affect mucin production, such as cystic fibrosis . Snail Mucus Used for Bioinspired Materials:
 The same porcine gastric mucin column has been used to evaluate flavor retention by the food industry. The mucin column was shown to mimic a bovine tongue for flavor retention, which reduces the need for and could potentially eliminate animal testing . Mucins have been extensively studied in their role with flavor perception . The presence of mucins within the oral cavity has been directly correlated to increased sedimentation of flavorproducing compounds, which in turn increases flavor perception . This phenomenon is also being examinned as the cause for the loss of taste in old age . Decreased levels of MUC7 in saliva has been noted in older individuals decreased taste . This downregulation is believed to reduce mucoadhesion of the flavor molecules, leading to attenuated taste perception. A Snail's Pace to Characterization of Mucin Molecules:
 Despite growing interest in the field, there are still many obstacles that prevent advancements in snail mucin research. Many snail species that have the potential for novel mucin discovery are often inaccessible because of their habitat. The lack of readily accessible biological material samples and difficulty in identifying mucin structures prevents the reliable synthesis of mucins in quantities sufficient for repeated experimentation. Several groups are investigating sustainable, scalable approaches to producing synthetic mucins, however the field is in its infancy  While mucins that have been isolated from the A. fulica have been extensively studied, other species remain neglected . A Snail's Pace to Characterization of Mucin Molecules:
 The most viable method for commercial mucin production remains extraction and isolation from animals, which does not allow for substantial yields for application without abundant animal capital and generally involves invasive methods. The complexity, abundance, and localization of glycosylation patterns on each mucin, in addition to various mucin glycoforms cause difficulty in employing common separation methods to purify, synthesize, and analyze mucin samples . Mucins often undergo posttranslational modifications, such as O-sulfation, N-sulfation, and N-deacetylation that differentiate function between proteins . These posttranslational glycan modifications are a hurdle to mucin sample purification, characterization, and synthesis. A promising synthetic approach involves using recombinant bacteria, glycosyltransferase(GT)-mediated polymerization, and trans-glycosylation . However, these methods are insufficient to achieve industrially practical yields and will fail to generate the exhaustive set of glycoforms that comprise natural mucus gels. There is still difficulty in creating the O-glycosylation in yeast, and there are challenges involved in transferring glycosylation branches to chosen protein residues. These issues present a need for developing viable and high yield methods for synthesizing mucins using scalable chemistries, which would be the first step in using mucins as targeted t h e r a p i e so rt r e a t m e n t s ."

As summarized below, the limited data available indicate that direct crosstalk between intestinal microbes and goblet cells is indeed likely. Microbial-derived factors altering the chemical composition of mucus:
 When the lipopolysaccharide of an indigenous E. coli strain was administered to germfree rats, an increase of colonic neutral mucin was paralleled by enhanced attachment of the indigenous E. coli strain to secreted mucin, perhaps reflecting an ability of E. coli to alter mucin chemistry for their own benefit . This concept is consistent with remarkable data from Bry et al  showing that monoassociation (exposure to one defined bacterial 1136S DEPLANCKE AND GASKINS strain) of germfree mice with wild-type Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (a gut commensal) induced host expression of ␣-1,2fucosyltransferase messenger RNA and subsequent production of fucosylated glycoconjugates on small-intestinal epithelial cells. An isogenic mutant B. thetaiotaomicron strain that lacks the ability to utilize L-fucose did not restore the fucosylation program in monoassociated mice. The factors enabling B. thetaiotaomicron to regulate host cell fucosylation remain unidentified, but appear to be soluble and their effect is density dependent . It was proposed that low fucose concentrations induce bacterial genes whose products activate the host fucosylation program . Consequently, B. thetaiotaomicron would be able to trigger the host to produce a readily digestible substrate, fucose, for its own metabolism when fucose availability decreases. Bacterial substrates and metabolites produced from mucin digestion should also be investigated for their ability to exert feedback control on goblet cell functions. Microbial mucolysis:
 An ability to enzymatically degrade mucus was documented in pathogens and commensals alike and appears to be a common trait among bacteria . Enzymatic digestion of the mucus coat provides access to readily available sources of carbon and energy and enables bacteria to reach the epithelial surface. Mucin degradation is a multistep process that begins with proteolysis of the nonglycosylated ""naked"" regions of the mucin glycoproteins by host and microbial proteases . This initial step markedly reduces mucin gelation and viscosity and results in the accumulation of highly glycosylated subunits (> 500 kDa) that are resistant to further proteolytic attack. Mucin glycopeptides are then degraded by various bacterial enzymes corresponding to the complexity of the oligosaccharide chains, which again differ in size, degree of branching, type of linkage, and the presence of terminal sialic acid or sulfate groups. For example, terminal sulfate and sialic acid residues are cleaved by bacterial sialidases and glycosulfatases, and oligosaccharide side chains are degraded by linkage-specific glycosidases ."

However, the understanding of active microbiota under in vitro ruminal fermentation conditions is still insufficient. To investigate how rumen microbes actively participate in the fermentation process in vitro, we resolved the metaproteome generated from ruminal fermentation broth after seven days of in vitro incubation. Herein, the sample-specific database for metaproteomic analysis was constructed according to the metagenomic data of in vitro ruminal fermentation. Based on the sample-specific database, we found in the metaproteome that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes_A were the most active in protein expression, and over 50% of these proteins were assigned to gene categories involved in energy conversion and basic structures.

 The research on in vitro ruminal fermentation has gained more attention recently, while the understanding of the function of microbial intracellular and extracellular proteins in the process of in vitro fermentation is limited to a few studies. Our results demonstrated that the metaproteomic approach allows an in-depth investigation of the functional characteristics of microbial functional proteins under the conditions of in vitro ruminal fermentation. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes_A were most active in the expression of extracellular/intracellular proteins, which were mainly involved in maintaining basic metabolism and carbohydrate degradation. In addition, the rumen bacteria-derived ISMPs obtained from in vitro metaproteome showed an adherent phenotype related to substrate adhesion, and the adherent strategy of rumen bacteria was a potential unique way to sustain their population size in the RUSITEC system. In general, these results characterized the functional proteins and active microbiome under the conditions of in vitro ruminal fermentation and emphasized the role of extracellular proteins in in vitro ruminal fermentation.

 Rumen, a forestomach of ruminants, is a complex symbiotic ecosystem. In the rumen, various types of microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and virus) exist and they are known as the rumen microbiota. The rumen microbiota provides nutrients for the host ruminants by digestion of feed particles, especially indigestive fibrous material, and biosynthesis of metabolites like amino acids, lipids, and vitamins . The nutrients including volatile fatty acids, minerals, and other metabolites are absorbed and transported into the host's blood vessels through the rumen epithelium . Only small portion of rumen microbiota attaches to the rumen epithelium. Several rumen epithelial bacteria (epimural bacteria) and their functions in urea digestion, tissue recycling, and oxygen scavenging have been identified since 1960s . Recent studies showed the composition and expressed genes of the epimural community in response to subacute rumen acidosis challenges using meta-omics technologies . Although these culture-independent methods provide expansive information about the epimural community, culture-dependent studies about yet uncultured eprimural bacteria are essential to understand their functions in more depth. Introduction:
 Mucin is a host-derived glycoprotein composed of protein backbones and various oligosaccharides. Intestinal epithelial cells produce two types of mucins (secreted mucin and cell membrane-associated mucin). They have a role as barriers to prevent pathogens from penetrating the epithelial tissues . Mucin-degrading bacteria can degrade mucin and utilize it as an energy source. Some of them penetrate into the host epithelial cells with their mucin-degrading ability and show pathogenicity, others play roles as commensal bacteria . Studies on Akkermansia muciniphila, a commensal mucin-degrading bacterium, revealed that this bacterium improved the host metabolic disorders, such as obesity and insulin resistance, by controlling gut barrier permeability and inflammation . Introduction:
 In the bovine rumen, there are salivary mucin secreted from salivary glands and cell-membrane associated mucins expressed on rumen epithelial cells . In the 1960s, Fina et al. isolated five uncultured mucin-degrading rumen bacteria from rumen fluid and Mishra et al. determined mucin-degrading activity of several species of rumen bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, and Bacteroides ruminicola) . They focused on mucin-degrading bacteria floating in the rumen fluid and their roles in bloat syndrome. Subsequently, there has been few studies on mucindegrading bacteria floating in the rumen fluid nor them attached to the rumen epithelium."

Gut mucin degraders of healthy subjects were investigated, through a culture dependent and independent approach. The faeces of five healthy adults were subjected to three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources. The bacterial community was compared before and after the enrichment by 16S rRNA gene profiling. Bacteria capable of fermenting sugars, such as Anaerotruncus, Holdemania, and Enterococcaceae likely took advantage of the carbohydrate chains. Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae, Peptococcales, the Coriobacteriale Eggerthella, and a variety of Clostridia such as Oscillospiraceae, Anaerotruncus, and Lachnoclostridium, significantly increased and likely participated to the degradation of the protein backbone of mucin. The affinity of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae for mucin may facilitate the access to the gut mucosa, promoting gut barrier damage and triggering systemic inflammatory responses. Only three species of strict anaerobes able to grow on mucin were isolated from the enrichments of five different microbiota: Clostridium disporicum, Clostridium tertium, and Paraclostridium benzoelyticum. The limited number of species isolated confirms that in the gut the degradation of these glycoproteins results from cooperation and cross-feeding among several species exhibiting different metabolic capabilities.","deserve deeper investigation, including the genome sequencing and physiology studies, aiming to unveil the key functions that enabled growth on mucin, in particular their set of glycosyl hydrolases and proteases and their amino acid biosynthetic capability. Discussion:
 To date, Bacteroides and Akkermansia muciniphila have been recognized as main mucin degraders, with novel insights on endo-acting O-glycanases involved in the rst steps of glycan breakdown  . In this study, the relative abundance of Bacteroides did not increase signi cantly, even if some ASVs of Bacteroides heavily contributed to separate samples along both PCo1 or PCo2 in the Weighted UniFrac analysis, con rming the presence of some species greatly associated to mucin degradation. It is plausible that di erent populations of Bacteroides, which could not be discriminated into species by the partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, behaved di erently with respect to mucin breakdown, exerting contrary e ects and balancing the counts of the genus. Indeed, a wide number of ASVs attributed to Bacteroides presented opposite contributions along the principal coordinates, in agreement with the fact that the genus Bacteroides comprises tens of species that supply di erent and complementary functions to the intestinal community  . Discussion:
 One of the key members of the colonic mucus-associated microbiota is A. muciniphila. It releases monosaccharides and amino acids during mucin degradation, providing nutrients to other bacteria of the gut, and exerts bene cial e ects in various metabolic disorders, being generally negatively correlated with in ammation and metabolic disorders  . In this study, a sole ASV ascribed to Akkermansia was detected in 3 out of 5 set of samples. In subject 1, it was remarkably abundant in the founding microbiota (8.7%) but was negligible (0.2%) a er the enrichment steps. In samples 3 and 4, Akkermansia was initially < 0.6% and increased by one magnitude over the enrichment. It is plausible that in sample 1 the high initial load of Akkermansia prevented a net increase of the abundance, that was further squeezed by major increase in some other groups. Discussion:
 e absence of Bacteroides and Akkermansia also within the isolates is noteworthy. ese bacteria likely encountered some substrate limitation that hampered growth. In fact, the medium did not contain nitrogen sources other than mucin in order to be as much stringent as possible. us, all the amino acids had to be obtained from the protein backbone of mucin, and this might have been too challenging, in the absence of a cooperative crossfeeding. e composition of the medium and the choice of the pH are major drivers of microbial selection and a mucin-based medium with di erent composition would likely result in the isolation of di erent bacterial species. Another drawback of the present study was the use of mucin from porcine stomach, that mainly consists of MUC5AC and MUC6 mucins and di ers in purity and glycosylation pro le from the colonic one MUC2, but is a cheap and easily available substrate, commonly utilized to culture mucin degraders  ."

In recent years, a dozen carbohydrate-active enzymes from cultivated mucin degraders have been characterized. But yet, considering the fact that uncultured species predominate in the human gut microbiota, these biochemical data are far from exhaustive. In this study, we used functional metagenomics to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans. First, we performed a high-throughput screening of a fosmid metagenomic library constructed from the ileum mucosa microbiota using chromogenic substrates. The screening resulted in the isolation of 124 clones producing activities crucial in the degradation of human O- and N-glycans, namely sialidases, β-D-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, β-D-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase, and/or β-D-mannosidase. Thirteen of these clones were selected based on their diversified functional profiles and were further analyzed on a secondary screening. This step consisted of lectin binding assays to demonstrate the ability of the clones to degrade human intestinal mucus. In total, the structural modification of several mucin motifs, sialylated mucin ones in particular, was evidenced for nine clones. Sequencing their metagenomic loci highlighted complex catabolic pathways involving the complementary functions of glycan sensing, transport, hydrolysis, deacetylation, and deamination, which were sometimes associated with amino acid metabolism machinery. These loci are assigned to several Bacteroides and Feacalibacterium species highly prevalent and abundant in the gut microbiome and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans.","regardless of their medical status, than in European ones. What is more, compared to healthy subjects, these genes are more abundant in the microbiome of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis, but less abundant in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This is perfectly consistent with the low abundance of F. prausnitzii in the microbiome of CD patients, particularly those with ileal involvement , which could be connected with the ability of this species to interact with mucus through its glycan and proteic fractions, as highlighted here with the 9D11 locus. CONCLUSION:
 To conclude, our work constitutes the first activity-based metagenomic study targeting the glycan-mediated relationships between the human gut microbiota and the host. Until now, the identification of bacterial species and metabolic pathways involved in mucus degradation was restricted to cultured bacteria, tested for growth on complex mucin glycan structures of porcine origin. When combined to genomic and transcriptomic analyses, these studies allowed to identify mucin glycan utilization loci for the few dozen of targeted strains. Nevertheless, to date only a very small number of these pathways have been biochemically proven to degrade human mucin structures. CONCLUSION:
 In the present study, we designed a two-step functional screening strategy, which allowed us, for the first time, both to identify mucus degrading pathways from uncultured species of the microbiota, and to prove their ability to degrade specific motives of human colonic mucus. The mucin glycan utilization loci we discovered are highly prevalent and abundant in the microbiome, and present marked synthenies with loci from several prominent commensal strains from the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, most of them being known to forage on dietary glycans, but which had never been described to feed on mucin glycans. Our data highlight the metabolic flexibility of these abundant commensals, which would have the ability to easily redirect their metabolism from dietary polysaccharides to host-derived glycans, depending on the availability of resources. In addition, we highlighted the overabundance of certain of these (meta) genomic loci in the microbiome of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases. This particular trait, together with the proof of their involvement in the modification of human mucus, makes them new targets to study the host response to the degradation of the mucus firewall, and to elaborate new strategies to restore gut homeostasis, for example by using specific functional foods to divert over-abundant mucus foragers toward dietary glycans."

The studies of these enzymes in an in vivo context have started to reveal their importance in mucin utilization and gut colonization. It is now clear that bacteria evolved multiple specific CAZymes to overcome the diversity of linkages found in O-glycans. Additionally, changes in mucin degradation by gut microbiota have been associated with diseases like obesity, diabetes, irritable bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Thereby understanding how CAZymes from different bacteria work to degrade mucins is of critical importance to develop new treatments and diagnostics for these increasingly prevalent health problems.

 Since the discovery of the Haber-Bosch process, N has played a pivotal role in agricultural production and is a key nutrient influencing crop yields. Globally, demands for N fertilizer are growing (in parallel with the growing human population) and were expected to reach 119.4 million t in 2018 . Being a component of essential nutrients, N is critically important for animal growth and productivity. Ruminant livestock, however, are relatively inefficient utilizers of feed N. In research trials with dairy cows, milk N efficiency varied from 14 to 45% [average of 25 and 28% (SD = 4.1 and 3.6%) for North American and North European data, respectively] as reported in a meta-analysis by . Nitrogen mass balance data for dairy farms and beef feedlots showed the efficiency of feed N conversion into milk or BW gain of 27 and 14%, respectively . Nitrogen not retained in animal tissues or secreted in milk is excreted in urine and feces, contributing to water pollution, gaseous N emissions, and small particulate matter formation in the atmosphere . Urinary N is much more labile and susceptible to fast leaching and volatilization losses than fecal N. The large variation in urinary N excretion, compared with fecal N, presents an opportunity to manipulate diets to reduce urinary N excretion . Therefore, understanding N metabolism and studying processes and practices that can improve the efficiency of N utilization for productive purposes have been a primary focus of ruminant nutrition research for over a century . More recent research has gravitated toward mitigation of N emissions (i.e., ammonia, nitrate, and nitrous oxide) to the environment. Using the most accurate and precise measurement techniques is critical for obtaining reliable experimental results on N utilization by ruminants, for assessing the efficiency of N emission mitigation technologies, and for proper evaluation and interpretation of published data. Invited review: Nitrogen in ruminant nutrition: A review of measurement techniques INTRODUCTION:
 This review is intended to provide an in-depth analysis of the methods currently used to study N digestion and metabolism in ruminants and the fate of manure N. The review is based on the broad yet complementary expertise of the international consortium of scientists participating in the Global Network project within the Feed and Nutrition Network, which is part of the Livestock Research Group of the Global Research Alliance for Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (https: / / globalresearchalliance .org/ research/ livestock/ networks/ feed -nutrition -network; accessed October 1, 2018). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
 Several excellent papers  and classic texts such as  have reviewed experimental designs used in animal research. The goal of this section is not to repeat what has already been discussed elsewhere, but to focus primarily on the specific aspects of studies designed to investigate N metabolism in ruminant animals."
"Modelling volatile fatty acid dynamics and rumen function in lactating cows","https://scispace.com/paper/modelling-volatile-fatty-acid-dynamics-and-rumen-function-in-4i5u5pi7p3","2007","","","A. Bannink","","https://scispace.com/pdf/modelling-volatile-fatty-acid-dynamics-and-rumen-function-in-4i5u5pi7p3.pdf","Mathematical models are developed to quantity and integrate the various processes involved with rumen fermentation. Three extant mechanistic models of rumen fermentation were studied (Baldwin et al., Danfaer and Dijkstra et al.), each with a truly dynamic representation but different conceptual approach. The models were compared on mathematical representation of individual processes and their prediction accuracy was evaluated. Although the models predicted similar rates of substrate degradation and rumen outflow of organic matter, total crude protein and microbial protein, they differed substantially in representation of the underlying microbial mechanisms. The model of Baldwin et al. performed best in prediction of the combination of rumen pool sizes and duodenal flows, whereas the model of Dijkstra et al. was evaluated to deliver the most realistic outflow of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates. Further, it was identified that all models needed improvement with respect to the prediction of amounts and type of volatile fatty acids (VFA) produced. In a subsequent evaluation is was investigated to what extent individual model elements, of a selection of five, could be responsible for inaccurate VFA predictions. The results suggested that inaccuracy of stoichiometric coefficients of VFA yield from fermented substrate (VFA coefficients) and incorrect representations of VFA absorption kinetics are the most likely causes. New values of VFA coefficients were derived by regression of a stoichiometric model of VFA yield against data of VFA molar proportions observed in vivo in rumen fluid of lactating cows. Inputs to the model were observed rates of rumen substrate degradation. Regression against simulated data sets including random error indicated that the accuracy of this method to estimate VFA coefficients is acceptable. Estimates from regressions against in vivo data delivered new sets of VFA coefficients for roughage-rich and concentrate-rich diets. In a follow-up study the representation of stoichiometry was made pH-dependent. With regression of this model against in vivo data a profound effect of rumen pH on the type of VFA formed from rapidly fermentable carbohydrates was established. Besides VFA production, the rumen concentrations and the amount and profile of VFA available for the cow are also affected by absorption and metabolism of VFA by epithelial tissues in the rumen wall. A mechanistic model was constructed that represents the dynamics of these processes, including the effects of changes in VFA concentration differences between different compartments, the effect of competitive inhibition between VFA and the effect of changes in surface area and epithelial mass. Although some essential characteristics of VFA transport and intra-epithelial metabolism could be reproduced by the model, it was concluded that there is a definite need for more experimental data. It is concluded that various levels of functioning need to be included when representing whole rumen function. Besides intrinsic degadation characteristics and passage of ingested substrates, environmental conditions in the rumen and the functionality of the rumen wall need to addressed.","vivo measurements of fractional rate of NDF degradation were obtained. Both results match closely. Results of the studies by do not indicate such a match, probably because the in situ incubations were performed under different rumen fermentation conditions and in different animals. Advantages of a dynamic approach:
 To conclude, both examples illustrate the importance of fermentation conditions in the rumen to microbial activity and substrate degradation. Hence, factors characterising these conditions have to be represented in a rumen model for it to predict accurately. A dynamic modelling approach qualifies best for this purpose, in particular when relationships are essentially nonlinear. The next section will discuss important elements required in rumen modelling and the current state of the art.  ; in situ fractional rate of NDF degradation and observed fractional outflow rate of organic matter (OM) as inputs), and calculation with the ratio of in situ fractional rate of NDF degradation and the sum of in situ fractional rate of NDF degradation and in vivo fractional rate of OM outflow.

Essential elements of a rumen model:
 Almost every rumen model addresses the key processes in rumen fermentation, viz. degradation and outflow of various classes of substrates, growth and outflow of various functional classes of micro-organisms, and quantity and profile of VFA formed. However, models clearly differ in extent to which these processes are predicted as model outcomes or are predefined and treated as model inputs. Microbial growth:
 Non-dynamic models of microbial growth generally adopt a constant efficiency of microbial growth and must be considered empirical rather than mechanistic. Even the model of , with many mechanistic elements, applies a constant efficiency of microbial growth dependent on the fractional degradation rate of substrate among other things.  reviewed various approaches to representing microbial growth efficiency and argued on the basis of theoretical principles that it is related to fractional passage rate rather than fractional degradation rate. Both the dynamic models of  and  apply this concept and represent a mechanism for variable growth efficiency by distinction of substrate utilization for growth and non-growth purposes (Chapter 3). Also the model of  adopts a concept of variable growth efficiency, but its representation does not comply with those used in literature on microbial cultures (direct coupling of nutrient requirement and microbial composition). More recently,  abandoned the concept and used a similar approach to other (non-dynamic) rumen models. Microbial growth:
 Only the model of  represents intra-ruminal recycling of microbial matter (Chapter 2). It is well established that defaunating the rumen may increase the efficiency of microbial growth . By representing the process of predation of bacteria by protozoa and the effect of dietary composition on the presence of protozoa, the model is capable of reproducing the effects of intra-ruminal recycling on substrate degradation and apparent efficiency of microbial growth ."

One important, but understudied, factor is the natural host environment: mucus, which contains gel-forming glycoproteins (mucins) that display hundreds of glycan structures with potential regulatory function. Leveraging a tractable culture-based system to study how mucins influence oral microbial communities, we found that mucin glycans enable the coexistence of diverse microbes, while resisting disease-associated compositional shifts. Mucins from tissues with unique glycosylation differentially tuned microbial composition, as did isolated mucin glycan libraries, uncovering the importance of specific glycan patterns in microbiome modulation. We found that mucins shape microbial communities in several ways: serving as nutrients to support metabolic diversity, organizing spatial structure through reduced aggregation, and possibly limiting antagonism between competing taxa. Overall, this work identifies mucin glycans as a natural host mechanism and potential therapeutic intervention to maintain healthy microbial communities. ","glycan degradation machinery (Fig. , Supplementary Fig. ). These findings show that mucin glycans can serve as a nutrient source to benefit a wide range of bacteria from native saliva that is lost in glucose-or monosaccharide-based medium. Mucin glycans serve as a nutritive substrate to retain native genera and high diversity:
 To further probe the role of mucin-supported nutrition, we isolated strains of Mitis and Salivarius streptococci from native oral communities and characterized their growth when provided glucose, mucin, glycans, or pooled monosaccharides as the sole carbon source. Salivarius exhibited more rapid growth in the glucose medium compared with any of the mucin substrates, whereas Mitis growth was highest in the mucin medium at 8 h (Fig. ). Individual representative strains for these groups may not represent the heterogeneity of metabolic profiles among oral streptococci and this limitation should be considered in interpreting these results; however, these experiments indicate that nutrition may play a role in the competitive dynamics between Mitis and Salivarius streptococci in the sole carbon source context. Mucin glycans support metabolically rich microbial communities:
 To test whether the taxonomic diversity supported by mucin glycans is linked to more diverse metabolic function, we used Biolog EcoPlates to profile microbial communities' ability to oxidize various carbon sources. Oral communities were grown for 24 h in chemically-defined medium (including amino acids, vitamins, and other carbon sources) supplemented with either glucose, mucins, mucin glycans, or pooled monosaccharides. These communities were then diluted and inoculated into EcoPlates for metabolic profiling. Communities that had grown in mucin glycans exhibited the highest overall metabolic activity (average well color development) and metabolic richness (fraction of carbon sources utilized), followed by mucins, monosaccharides, then glucose and medium alone (Fig. ). Overall growth, monitored by OD 590 readings on a separate 96-well plate, was comparable between the different media (Fig. ). More specifically, communities that had grown in mucin glycans were able to utilize a wide range of carbon sources, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and carboxylic acids, while those grown with intact mucin polymers or pooled monosaccharides each utilized a subset of these carbon sources (Fig. , Supplementary Fig. ). Together with the sole carbon source experiments, these findings indicate that mucin glycans shape diverse microbial communities with rich metabolic function, potentially by serving as complex nutritive substrates to enable niche partitioning  and/or by regulating metabolic pathways  ."

 Finally, the interaction of mucin-type O-glycans with some commensal species can influence the growth of other commensal species.

 In total, the reported experiments further enlarge our knowledge on the applications of omics techniques to understand compositional and functional alterations of the ruminal microbes in response to diets. Most of the amylolytic and fibrolytic microbes reported in the literature were shown to be stable to dietary starch and fibre changes, although some exceptions, for example, the amylolytic bacteria Succinimonas amylolytica and Ruminococcus bromii were detected. The studies also showed that the microbial activities in the rumen are far more complicated than hitherto known. The microbes sensitive to the dietary treatments detected in the experiments will promote the isolation and characterization of new amylolytic and fibrolytic microbes from the rumen. The metabolic pathways analysis through metagenomics and metaproteomics confirmed that the starch and sucrose metabolism was promoted in the two glucogenic diets, which is associated with a higher level of pullulanase secreted by the Succinimonas amylolytica."

Most of O-glycans have N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as a common core. Several glycoproteins, such as mucins (MUCs), immunoglobulins, and caseins are examples of O-glycosylated structures. These glycans are further elongated with other monosaccharides and sulfate groups. Some of them could be found in dairy foods, while others are produced endogenously, in both cases interacting with the gut microbiota. Interestingly, certain gut microbes can access, release, and consume O-linked glycans as a carbon source. Among these, Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are prominent O-linked glycan utilizers. Their consumption strategies include specialized α-fucosidases and α-sialidases, in addition to endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases that release galacto-N-biose (GNB) from peptides backbones. O-linked glycan utilization by certain gut microbes represents an important niche that allows them to predominate and modulate host responses such as inflammation. Here, we focus on the distinct molecular mechanisms of consumption of O-linked GalNAc glycans by prominent gut microbes, especially from mucin and casein glycomacropeptide (GMP), highlighting the potential of these structures as emerging prebiotics.","CONCLUSION: O-glycans serve as signaling molecules for cell secretion and provide greater resistance to proteolysis .

 O-glycans derived from milk glycopeptides such as in GMP are an attractive opportunity to use them in foods as emerging prebiotics, promoting a healthy gut microbiota. Unfortunately, there are still several limitations to this goal, and no human studies have evaluated its prebiotic effect. While, we have advanced in understanding some of the molecular mechanisms involved in O-linked glycan utilization in single microorganisms, the impact of this utilization in metabolic interactions and networks has been evaluated only in a small number of studies. CONCLUSION:
 ese gaps have been hindered in part because we lack enzymes or other tools to recover full O-glycans from dairy streams or mucin sources. In contrast, certain enzymes have been described for the recovery of N-glycans from dairy byproducts. CONCLUSION:

 Moreover, the consequences for the host of the microbial utilization of O-glycans, or glycoproteins containing O-glycans, have not been evaluated and remains a critical question. Whether gut microbes accessing the mucus layer and releasing O-glycans is bene cial for the host is still unclear. Furthermore, the study of O-glycans utilization by the gut microbiota, and how these microbes shape mucin glycosylation patterns, should be further studied in the context of intestinal in ammation and IBDs, as well as cancer progression."

The Rumen ecosystem:
 Competition: the inhibitory effects of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens on the cellulolytic activity of ruminal fungi . The Rumen ecosystem:
 Factors such as composition of feed, the degree of physical processing and the presence of feed additives all affect the numbers, proportions and digestive activity of rumen micro organisms. Because of this confounding effect of diet on the composition of rumen microbes, the differences in microbial community structure between animal breeds have been difficult to assess. Because of this difficulty, the higher ability of certain breeds of ruminants to digest poor-quality feeds is mainly attributed to reduced rate of feed passage within the digestive tract and increase recycling of nitrogen to the rumen rather than superior rumen bacteria . The Rumen ecosystem:
 The identification of rumen bacteria has been carried out using several techniques such as gram positive reaction and cell morphology, motility, growth media, fermentation products, substrates fermented (Table ). In the eighties, a new system for the classification of micro organisms based on sequence comparisons of the ribosomal RNA gene was developed . The ribosomal RNA gene fulfils several requirements as an evolutionary marker gene. First it is ubiquitous, and apparently no horizontal gene transfer occurred . Recent studies of 16S rRNA and sequencing indicate that the diversity of ruminal bacteria has been greatly underestimated because many ruminal species have strains with little DNA or RNA similarity . Comparative sequencing of the rRNAs, principally the 16S-like rRNAs, has yielded the most complete understanding of microbial phylogeny . The analysis of the rRNA gene not only revolutionised bacterial taxonomy, but also allows the tracking of organisms with rRNA-targeted probes in a complex microbial ecosystem . Despite the availability of probes for the evaluation of cell wall degrading, methanogenic and protein degrading communities (Table ) the effects of animal's genetics on rumen micro organisms have not been extensively explored. Our challenge in the present study is the first attempt to compare the cell wall degrading community of two breeds of cattle fed the same diets (three different compositions) in consecutive experiments. In vitro gas production technique:
 There is a long history of characterising ruminant feeds by incubating them in vitro with buffered rumen fluid to simulate rumen fermentation . The gas production technique has been developed using this methodology . The gas production technique also generates kinetic information, but rather than measuring the disappearance of dietary components, it measures the appearance of fermentation gases notably carbon dioxide and methane. Compared to the in situ degradability technique, the gas production method is less animal dependent. In vitro gas production technique:
 The technique allows to generate also information on the volatile fermentation products  and the microbial biomass production . The gas production has also been used to estimate the metabolisable and net energy content of feeds , to predict feed intake, digestibility, microbial nitrogen supply and animal performance .

To investigate larval exsheathment, a closed in vitro system that effectively reproduces the two basic components of an anaerobic rumen environment (CO2 and 39 °C) was developed to trigger exsheathment in one of the most pathogenic and model gastrointestinal parasitic nematode, Haemonchus contortus (barber‘s pole worm). This project applied the basic principles of dialysis and is the first reported use of all currently available non-specific metabolomics methodologies to identify the rumen-derived trigger compounds associated with larval development in H. contortus. Herein, we report an multimodal untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses based on 20 kDa (n = 10), 8-10 kDa (n = 10) and 100 Da (n = 10) molecular weight cut-off dialyzed rumen fluid fractions, all of which demonstrated positive effects on exsheathment induction in vitro under rumen conditions, as compared to control infective third-stage larva (L3) in saline (n = 10). Metabolite identification and multivariate analyses resulted in a catalogue of over one thousand structurally annotated compounds or metabolites that form three distinct cluster groups and warrant further investigation. The multimodal metabolomics analyses revealed significant alterations between the three different rumen fluid fractions in L-lactic acid, pyruvate metabolism, gluconeogenesis, the Warburg effect, plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, and biosynthesis of amino acids metabolism. Lysophosphatidylglycerol, diglyceride, phosphatidylcholine, triglyceride and a sterol were the major lipid classes identified by the non-targeted lipidomics method applied. A combination of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed a panel of metabolites directly responsible for larval exsheathment and associated with amino acids as well as purine and pyruvate metabolism KEGG pathways. Among these were compounds such as methionine, leucine, alanine, phenylalanine, xanthine and hypoxanthine, that were significant in the control group and identified using two separate metabolomics streams. This study presents an in vitro system suitable for numerous functional omics’ experimentation applications and has enhanced our understanding of the distinct molecular and metabolic pathways associated with larval exsheathment. The identified metabolites may serve as metabolic signatures or novel metabolic biomarkers for pre-diagnostic purposes of haemonchosis. Alternatively, our findings can be used to develop next-generation biomimicry agents to cause infective larvae of parasitic nematodes to exsheath outside the host while on pasture for experimental or control purposes.","metabolome database focused on extremely low molecular weight metabolites. When coupled with the advent of sequencing technologies and availability of genomic and transcriptomic datasets, is a comprehensive approach for the identification of these peaks and characterization of the ovine rumen fluid molecular mechanisms. Potential use:
 Different molecular weight cut-offs to separate out different components of the rumen led to different metabolite and lipid profiles. While this finding is not surprising, it does suggest that fractionating rumen fluid prior to extraction and analysis could give insights into metabolic activity occurring in relation to the solid residue present compared to the more active liquid matrix. Biologically this may be due to the effects of dialysis on fermentation patterns and subsequent shifts in microbial population during continuous culture. For example, accumulation of particular fermentation end-products and variations in the composition of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) can rapidly inhibit microbial growth within the rumen. Further work is needed to establish whether higher molecular weight fractions can provide insight into the degree of breakdown of plant material. Potential use:
 This study is the first report of the ovine rumen metabolome, and while due to the collection method used is not directly comparable to previously published bovine rumen metabolomes, represents an important reference dataset. Our dataset should enable microbiologists and livestock researchers to conduct more targeted metabolomic studies to identify low molecular weight features where further metabolome coverage is required. Further research will be done on this prototype model, including additional data mining and annotation of the metabolite features and investigation into the microbial community profiles within the different dialysis contents using next-generation sequencing technology, as these microbiome signatures may have critical implications into various livestock metabolomics applications.

Experimental Findings and Future Directions:
 Identifying novel cellulose metabolizing bacteria was the focal point of this project, however, I am also interested in bacteria able to metabolize downstream byproducts of cellulose degradation. Ruminal fluid cultures would initially be supplemented with by-products such as cellodextrin and cellobiose, and enrichment could be compared to cultures containing the same rumen fluid, except supplemented with cellulose. Experimental Findings and Future Directions:
 Differences in enrichment could be used to suggest metabolic capabilities for the enriched OTUs. Experimental Findings and Future Directions:
 Future directions for this experiment could also include cultivation-based work. Experimental Findings and Future Directions:
 Using autoclaved rumen fluid from an enriched sample supplemented with cellulose, a synthetic agar-based medium could be synthesized. Under anaerobic conditions, plates would be streaked with the sample containing the enriched organism from the rumen fluid used to make the media. Ideally, colonies of the enriched organism(s) would grow and could be isolated for pure culture DNA extraction. Impact of Research:
 The majority of research within the field of ruminant microbiology studies rumen microorganisms as a community, whether it is analyzing microbial diversity using phylogenetic markers, metagenomics searching for carbohydrate-active genes or other broad categories of genes, or metatranscriptomics looking at metabolically active genes within a community . Few studies focus on individual populations of microorganisms, with the exception of rumen bacteria that have already been well-characterized . While it is necessary to analyze rumen microbial community responses to specific treatments, more emphasis needs to be made on identifying functionality in individual populations of microbes in order to gain further insight on the organisms responsible for specific substrate degradation. The research outlined in this thesis thus aimed at identifying uncharacterized populations of bacteria involved in cellulose metabolism, and served as a stride forward towards further characterizing the rumen microbiome. Impact of Research:
 The onset of next-generation sequencing has revealed the very high diversity of the rumen microbiome, with only a fraction having been cultured as isolates. Proposed explanations regarding the difficulty in culturing most anaerobic organisms include the lack of understanding of optimal physiochemical and environmental conditions for individual organisms, and symbiotic relationships essential to survival . A number of cellulolytic bacteria have been identified using cultivation-based methods, including Fibrobacter succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, R. albus, and P. ruminicola. However, metagenomics studies have revealed an abundance of cellulosedegrading genes that do not belong to the genome of these previously identified cellulolytic organisms, indicating that a large number of organisms involved in its metabolism remain unidentified . Impact of Research:
 Due to our lack of knowledge on how to cultivate the majority of rumen microorganisms, alternative approaches should be used to single out select populations for an in-depth analysis of complex communities such as the rumen ecosystem."

 Genomic and metagenomic sequencing have greatly expanded the number of predicted microbial enzymes that degrade polysaccharides, the GHs and polysaccharide lyases (PL; ). Based on these activities predicted from the GH/PL profile of a given organism's or ecosystem's sequence, it is possible to infer the polysaccharide degrading potential, and these predictions are fueling hypothesis-driven experiments that aid definitive characterization . Figure  shows GH activities that are required for mucin degradation, and co-occurrence of these enzymes in bacterial operons often serve as a signature of mucin-degrading capacity of a microbe. These enzymes are typically exo-hydrolases (release monosaccharides from the non-reducing terminus of the glycan) and are often secreted or cell-surface associated likely in order to facilitate the liberation of terminal monosaccharides from the massive mucin molecules. Microbes adept at mucin degradation often encode sulfatases, acetylases, α-sialidases and α-fucosidases. The removal of these monosaccharides and modifications that often terminate mucin glycan structures is required for further monosaccharide liberation from the extended core structures. The free monosaccharides produced in this de-capping process may be utilized by the bacterium responsible for liberation in either catabolic or biosynthetic (e.g. capsule biosynthesis) metabolism or shed into the ecosystem for consumption by another microbe ). Production of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase that allows the hydrolysis of the common O-glycosidic linkages between galactose β1-3/4-N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine in mucin peptide backbone is another indication of a mucin-adapted microorganism . Furthermore, the presence of N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidases, β-galactosidases or lacto-N-biosidases )i s additional activities that are consistent with mucin degradation. Mucus on the menu:

Functional genomics and molecular genetics have expanded our insight into how the machinery encoded by a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) accomplishes the task of turning an extracellular glycan into an intracellular glycolytic substrate and how a single bacterium can efficiently regulate over 80 loci with differing specificities depending upon nutrient availability ."

Microbial turnover in the rumen occurs both by autolysis and predation. Mechanisms of autolysis are not well studied, but might contribute considerably to intraruminal N recycling when ruminal retention times are long. Microbial Growth Efficiency:
 Protozoal predation can have significant effects on microbial efficiency and is often considered the primary cause of bacterial turnover in the rumen. Research with defaunated animals has shown that absence of protozoa increased duodenal microbial N flow and bacterial efficiency, and reintroduction of protozoa subsequently decreased these variables . Microbial Growth Efficiency:
 Protozoa were not believed to have direct advantage for the host animal, because they reduce bacterial growth efficiency and do not contribute significantly to duodenal N flow, because they are selectively retained in the rumen . Microbial Growth Efficiency:
 However, reduced OM and NDF digestibility in defaunated animals suggests that protozoa probably do contribute to ruminal fermentation . A substantial portion of ruminal fiber digestion is due to protozoal degradation . Additionally, protozoa engulf starch particles and digest them more slowly than do ruminal bacteria, thus potentially modulating ruminal pH . Microbial Growth Efficiency:
 Although the presence of protozoa may reduce bacterial efficiency by predation, the absence of protozoa may reduce bacterial efficiency to a greater extent by low ruminal pH. Measuring Microbial Protein:
 There are a variety of markers used to measure post-ruminal MCP flow. Purines are commonly used to quantify rumen microbial growth. Nucleic acids are composed of purine bases, adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine bases, cytosine, uracil, and thymine."
"Response of urinary purine derivatives excretion to nutritional factors affecting ruminal microbial protein synthesis in cattle.","https://scispace.com/paper/response-of-urinary-purine-derivatives-excretion-to-4edcbpt9dj","2015","Dissertation","","Veronika Sandra Ahnert","","https://scispace.com/pdf/response-of-urinary-purine-derivatives-excretion-to-4edcbpt9dj.pdf","The protein synthesis by rumen microbes plays a central role in ruminant nutrition, providing more than half of the essential amino acids that are available for absorption at the small intestine. Therefore, the accurate quantification of duodenal microbial crude protein (MCP) flow is a key issue in ruminant nutrition in order to provide especially high producing ruminants with adequate amounts of protein and to improve production performance and efficiency of nitrogen utilization. The excretion of purine derivatives (PD) via the urine is a non-invasive indicator for estimating duodenal MCP flow in ruminant animals and has the potential to be used even under on-farm conditions. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the response of urinary PD excretion to nutritional factors affecting ruminal MCP synthesis in two animal studies in order to evaluate the accuracy and validity of this indicator to reflect changes in MCP supply. 
In the first study, four rumen-cannulated heifers were infused intraruminally with increasing dosages of glucose, a rapidly fermentable carbohydrate source, to stimulate MCP synthesis and to verify the linearity between glucose dosage and urinary PD excretion. Urinary PD excretion increased with glucose infusion, however, against our expectations, the relationship between glucose dosage and urinary PD excretion was not linear. A pronounced increase in PD excretion was observed at lowest glucose dosage and any increment in glucose dosage did not lead to further increments. In contrast, fecal nitrogen excretion linearly increased with increasing glucose dosage which is most likely due to a greater excretion of MCP synthesised in the rumen. This contradicting response between urinary PD and fecal nitrogen excretion to incremental dosages of glucose infusion is at least attributed to shifts in the species composition of rumen microbial consortium causing changes in the purine concentration of the microbial biomass, limiting the accuracy of the urinary PD excretion as a non-invasive indicator. 
In the second study, six rumen-cannulated heifers were used to investigate the effects of intraruminal infusion of increasing dosages of commercial Quebracho tannin extract (QTE), a condensed tannin source, on apparent total tract nutrient digestibilities, nitrogen balance, and urinary PD excretion. Moderate to high QTE dosages (≥ 4 % of dry matter intake) reduced apparent total tract digestibility of organic matter especially that of structural carbohydrates, lowering energy supply to the host. The QTE infusion greatly shifted nitrogen excretion towards feces, which is desired from an environmental perspective. Urinary PD excretion declined linearly with increasing QTE dosage reflecting a decrease in duodenal MCP flow which is mainly attributed to inhibiting effects of QTE infusion on rumen microbial growth. At moderate to high QTE dosages, it is unlikely that the increase in rumen-escape protein will lead to greater post-ruminal amino acid absorption due to pronounced reductions in duodenal MCP flow. According to these findings, the addition of QTE to ruminant diets does not improve protein supply and performance of cattle.
The results of the present thesis indicate that the urinary PD excretion as a non-invasive indicator appears to be able to reflect changes in duodenal MCP flow. However, for situations when considerable amounts of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates and condensed tannins are part of the diet, the accuracy of estimating duodenal MCP flow from urinary PD excretion is limited.","Title: 3 Influence of ruminal Quebracho tannin extract infusion on apparent nutrient digestibility, nitrogen balance, and urinary purine derivatives excretion in heifers Authors: Sandra Ahnert,Uta Dickhoefer,Franziska Schulz,Andreas Susenbeth General introduction:
 The ruminant digestive system maintains a symbiotic relationship with ruminal microorganisms. This symbiosis enables the host animal to utilize fibrous plant biomass and non-protein nitrogen (N) as food resources that would not be utilizable otherwise and make ruminants independent of external sources of B-vitamins and amino acids . General introduction:
 The ruminal fermentation is a result of physical and microbiological activities converting complex lignocellulosic plant material into microbial biomass and valuable fermentation end products (i.e. short-chain fatty acids) that can be used by the host animal. Microbial fermentation occurs under continuous-culture conditions, whereby the frequent intake of feed, removal of end products, and outflow of microbial biomass enables a continual growth of ruminal microbes . The microbial biomass which is not recycled within the rumen and leaves the rumen accounts for more than 50 % of protein available for absorption at the small intestine  and greatly contributes the animals' supply of essential amino acids. The microbial crude protein (MCP) is characterized by a high and relatively constant quality because it is rich in most of the essential amino acids . The rumen microbial ecosystem is complex and highly diverse, consisting of bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and fungi. Growth of rumen microbes mainly depends on the availability of N sources (i.e. true protein, non-protein N) and of energy for protein synthesis coming from the fermentation of structural and non-structural carbohydrates which provides carbon skeletons . If dietary rumen degradable protein is in excess relative to the amount required by rumen microbes, ammonia-N is absorbed, metabolized to urea in the liver, and excreted via urine and milk. Therefore, the synchrony of the availability of ruminal degradable protein and carbohydrate may influence microbial growth and efficiency of MCP synthesis , although reports in the literature are inconsistent . The yield of microbial biomass is not solely determined by the availability of nutrients for microbial growth, but also by the energy used by rumen microbes for maintenance which in turn depends on the maintenance requirements and growth rate of the microbial species . Therefore, the efficiency of MCP synthesis (i.e. g MCP/ kg organic matter fermented) is not constant. Besides these nutritional factors mentioned, other non-nutritional factors such as ruminal pH value , rate of digestion and passage , and defaunation  influence microbial growth and efficiency of MCP synthesis."

It is predicted that a table spoon of ruminal fluid can reside up to 150 billion microorganisms including various species of bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Several studies in the past have extensively explained about the structural and functional physiology of the rumen. Studies based on rumen and its microbiota has increased significantly in the last decade to understand and reveal applications of the rumen microbiota in food processing, pharmaceutical, biofuel and biorefining industries. Recent high-throughput meta-genomic and proteomic studies have revealed humongous information on rumen microbial diversity. In this study, we have extensively reviewed and reported present-day's progress in understanding the rumen microbial diversity. As of today, NCBI resides about 821,870 records based on rumen with approximately 889 genome sequencing studies. We have retrieved all the rumen-based records from NCBI and extensively catalogued the rumen microbial diversity and the corresponding genomic and proteomic studies respectively. Also, we have provided a brief inventory of metadata analysis software packages and reviewed the metadata analysis approaches for understanding the functional involvement of these microorganisms.

These studies have also reported the tentative molecular networks employed by these fungi during plant biomass degradation . We have pictorially represented the tentative metadata analysis workflow implemented in previous studies, for analyzing and understanding the genomic and proteomic datasets (Figure ). Potential Applications:
 Rumen microbiota exhibit several potential applications in the dairy, feedstock, winery and brewery, pulp and paper, biofuel, biorefinery, textiles-detergent, food and pharmaceutical industries. Rumen microbiota can be potentially used in preparation of industrially important enzyme mixtures such as cellulases, xylanases, pectinases, amylases, lipases and proteases, which are widely used in various industrial processes . Recent studies have proved the importance of rumen microorganisms in the breakdown and conversion of lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin) to commercially important products such as bioethanol and other platform chemicals including hydrogen, butanol, iso-butanol, methane and other energy yielding products . Enhancing the rate of digestion and metabolism of the feedstock by cattle is one of the major challenges in the dairy and feedstock industries. Several studies were continuously being conducted with rumen microorganisms and the enzymes secreted by these for pretreating the feedstock to enhance its digestion rate by ruminating animals . Simultaneously, studies were also being conducted to develop genetically modified microorganisms (especially bacteria) to improve the process of digestion and enhance the rumen function . Thus, understanding the microbial diversity of rumen will significantly benefit various industrial processes. Conclusions:
 All the above studies and reports strongly endorses that ruminating animals are solely dependent on their microbiota for their daily metabolism. Recent studies based on gut microbiomes of several ruminating animals, termite, mice and human have significantly enhanced the current knowledge about gut residing microorganisms. The JGI-MycoCosm and Hungate 1000 microbial genome sequencing projects revealed whole genome sequences of about 1087 fungal genomes and 501 rumen microorganisms. Although studies have reported that one milliliter of ruminal fluid contains approximately 10 5 to 10 6 protozoans and about 10 10 to 10 11 of bacterial inhabitants, there is still a long way in understanding the rumen microbiome and their role in physiology of ruminating animals. In this article we have extensively discussed the recent advancements in understanding the role of rumen microbiota in the degradation and metabolism of plant biomass. We have studied and listed all the genomic and proteomic studies based on rumen and ruminal microbiota. Further studies about the ruminal microbiota may benefit various industrial sectors significantly, including biofuel, biorefining, pretreatment of cattle feedstocks and several other processes.

This is considerably less than the generally accepted minimal yield of 4 to 5 moles of ATP per mole of hexose or hexose equivalent (=162 g of polysaccharide) fermented in the rumen . Mechanism of Microbial Breakdown of Dietary Protein in the Forestomachs:
 A further reason for degradation of excess amino acids by rumen bacteria may be the lack of mechanisms to transport amino acids from the cytoplasm across the cell wall into the surrounding medium. It has been found that some strains of rumen bacteria require NH 3 , even if amino acids are present in their growth medium. One of these is the strain Bacteriodes ruminicola, which, however, can utilize peptides from the growth medium , suggesting a lack of transport systems for individual amino acids across the cell wall. In order to excrete excess amino acids, they would need to be degraded first. Measuring the Degradation:
 of Dietary Protein. Various methods, both in vitro and in vivo, have been developed for measuring the degradation of dietary protein in the forestomachs of ruminants. Measuring the Degradation:
 In vitro methods are generally based on either the release of ammonia after incubation with rumen liquor, or on the estimate of the proportion of N which goes into solution after incubation at body temperature for a fixed time. With respect to the latter method, various solutions have been applied as an incubation medium, such as diluted NaOH , artificial saliva , autoclaved rumen fluid , diluted solution of pepsin in .1 N HO  and water at various temperatures . The various methods have been discussed  and incubation with artificial saliva at body temperature was considered the most attractive. A complication of this method is the presence of N containing salts in the incubation mixture, causing high blank values. Measuring the Degradation:
 Studying protein degradation by ammonia release after incubation with rumen liquor has the disadvantage of microbial growth occurring simultaneously with protein degradation. Because of this growth, part of the released ammonia may become incorporated into microbial protein. A general limitation of all in vitro methods is that, although they may yield a value for degradability, they do not yield data representing actual degradation in vivo. Attempts were made to overcome this problem by studying the kinetics of protein degradation resulting in a measure of degradation rate . Combining this rate with the rumen liquor turnover rate may yield figures that give an estimate of degradation close to the actual degradation in vivo."

As dairy cattle are a dominant production animal in the USA, their biofluids such as milk, blood, urine, and rumen fluid have been examined by proteomic analysis. The research outlined herein was performed to further characterize the dynamics of specific proteomes and relate them to dairy cattle physiology. The first experiment evaluated the diurnal dynamicity of the rumen metaproteome in Holstein dairy cattle. Rumen fluid was collected from three mid to late lactation multiparous dairy cattle (207 ± 53.5 days in milk) at three time points relative to their first morning offering of a total mixed ration (TMR) (0 h, 4 h, and 6 h after feeding). Samples were processed and labeled using Tandem Mass tagging before being further fractionated with a high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and statistically analyzed for variations across hour of sampling using the MIXED procedure of SAS with orthogonal contrasts. A total of 242 proteins were characterized across 12 microbial species, with 35 proteins identified from a variety of 9 species affected by time of collection. Translation-related proteins were correlated positively with increasing hour of sampling while more specific metabolic proteins were negatively correlated with increasing hour of sampling. Results suggest that as nutrients become more readily available, microbes shift from conversion-focused biosynthetic routes to more encompassing DNA-driven pathways. The second experiment aimed to characterize the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) proteomes of colostrum and transition milk for comparison from multi(n = 10) and primiparous (n = 10) Holstein dairy cattle. Samples were collected at four timepoints post-partum (milkings 1, 2, 4, and 14). After isolation of the protein lysates from the MFGM, proteins were labeled using Tandem Mass tagging and analyzed using LCMS/MS techniques. Protein identification was completed using MASCOT and Sequest in Proteome Discoverer 2.2. Protein abundance values were scaled and analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS to determine the effect of parity, milking number, and parity x milking number, and the adaptive false-discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P values were determined using the MULTTEST procedure of SAS. There were 104 proteins identified within the MFGM. Statistical analysis revealed that 44.2% of proteins were affected by parity, 70.2% by milking number, and 32.7% by the variable of parity x milking number. There was a two-fold difference in calcium sensing S100 proteins in cows differing in parity possibly due to the multiparous mammary gland being more adapted to the physiological demand of lactation or the lesser requirement of calcium in primiparous cows because of a lower production rate.","variations in these profiles could be elucidated using this approach. An additional aim was to use similar techniques to characterize the proteome of the MFGM over a time period rather than at a static point for a more comprehensive understanding of transition milk composition. Introduction:
 The pregastric rumen is the dominant site of microbial colonization and microbemediated fermentation within the ruminant digestive tract, and functionality of this chamber is a key factor that dictates the animal's efficiency of nutrient utilization and production . Introduction:
 Nutrient utilization, ruminant animal health, and environmental emissions are all affected by rumen ecology, hence there is strong interest within the ruminant livestock sector to understand the functionality of rumen microbes. Current knowledge of the rumen microbiome is cross-disciplinary and rapidly expanding, with novel research emerging that is focused on diversity analysis and community structures of the microbiota , as well as metabolic pathway analysis and metatranscriptomics . Introduction:
 Despite advances in our understanding, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding the undercurrents and interplay of microbe-specific metabolic pathways because of their dynamicity, adaptability, and complexity. Utilizing a variety of approaches to characterize the rumen in terms of microbial ecology and pathway dynamics appears to be necessary. For instance, microbial diversity analysis has revealed that basal diet and diurnal rumen pH patterns can be somewhat independent of bacterial community profile , while more recently, Söllinger et al.  paired metabolomics with quantitative metatranscriptomics to assess the diurnal fluctuations of individual rumen microorganisms and also reported a dissociation between the functional microbial transcripts and microbiome pathway products such as methane. Layered within these challenges, the central dogma of translation appears to be disjointed, with microbial RNA not reflective of protein abundances within the rumen, possibly due to post-translational modifications along with other adaptations . In addition, issues such as a limitation in analytic capabilities to discern in vivo complexities and variations due to external drivers such as endogenous and management influences, have slowed progress and the application of knowledge to commercial systems.

 Proteomic techniques are now integrated in livestock research, with published applications in milk , urine , plasma , and reproductive fluid ."

As pathogens becoming resistant to antibiotics are a growing concern worldwide, alternative strategies to treat infections in farmed animals are necessary in order to decrease the risk to human health and increase animal health and productivity. Mucosal surfaces are the most common route used by pathogens to enter the body. The mucosal surface that lines the gastrointestinal tract is covered by a continuously secreted mucus layer that protects the epithelial surface. The mucus layer is the first barrier the pathogen must overcome for successful colonization, and is mainly composed of densely glycosylated proteins called mucins. The vast array of carbohydrate structures present on the mucins provide an important setting for host-pathogen interactions. This review summarizes the current knowledge on gastrointestinal mucins and their role during infections in farmed animals. We examine the interactions between mucins and animal pathogens, with a focus on how pathogenic bacteria can modify the mucin environment in the gut, and how this in turn affects pathogen adhesion and growth. Finally, we discuss analytical challenges and complexities of the mucus-based defense, as well as its potential to control infections in farmed animals.","exposing GlcNAc . Calcium ion levels and pH also play a role in the adhesion and growth mechanism of A. salmonicida in contact with salmon mucins, underlining the importance of environmental factors in fish host-pathogen interactions . Methodological Considerations for Mucus/Mucin Studies:
 The interest in mucus and mucins has expanded notably during recent years, and for researchers moving into this field, it is important to be aware of factors that result in commonly used tools to investigate changes after challenge being less suitable for mucin studies compared to other molecules. Firstly, the secreted mucins are very large and do not typically enter standard gels used for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), instead, what is found on such gels are either small (i.e., membrane bound) mucins or fragments of the large mucins, indicating the need for special gels. Secondly, since mucins are to 85% carbohydrate and subject to major post-translational regulation, mucin mRNA levels do not always reflect the amount of mucin/mucus being produced . Histology on its own, without for example metabolic labelling can also be deceptive because important mucus functions are mainly carried out after secretion. Mucin production and secretion rate are important parameters in this context, secreted mucus is lost during processing using most histology methods and mainly the amount of mucus inside the goblet cells is evaluated. A decreased secretion could lead to an increased amount of mucus in the cells, and conversely, an increased secretion could lead to a decreased amount of mucus in the cells, none of which reflects the amount of mucus produced. Furthermore, these methods do not take into account the complexity of mucus, mucins, and mucin glycosylation. Therefore, it is necessary to combine several methods, such as glycan analysis, metabolic labeling of mucins, and histological evaluation to get a more complete understanding of mucus related events. Complexities and Potential:
 Several studies suggest that mucus and mucins are important for regulating growth, composition, and behavior of the microflora (including pathogens), and that these in turn regulate mucus and mucins. For example, the commensal flora can improve the mucus barrier and pathogens can affect mucus via the inflammatory response, thus these factors are intertwined. However, the mucus-pathogen interactions are complex and depend on microbe and host species; therefore, in order to achieve such advancements, more knowledge is needed on this topic. One can envision many aspects where these systems can be utilized to prevent/treat disease, such as via feeds that enhance the mucus barrier and shape a beneficial microflora, potentially decreasing the amount and severity of infections, or via feeding a beneficial microflora directly. Furthermore, breeds may differ in mucus related parameters such as mucin glycosylation, and selective breeding could take mucin mutations and glycosylation into account once an ""ideal"" mucin repertoire has been identified. There is also potential for temporary ""mucus boosting"" treatment, for example with the purpose of ""flushing out"" a pathogen or to prophylactically enhance the barrier to prevent infections from spreading within a site."

The intestinal epithelial cells and microbiota reciprocally regulate each other in order to maintain intestinal homeostasis and control inflammation. However, a relative paucity of research has been focused on the host-derived regulatory network that controls mucin O -glycans and thereby changes gut microbiota during diarrhea in infancy. At the development stage just after birth, the ontogeny of intestinal epithelium, immune system, and gut microbiota appear similar in piglets and human infants. Here, we investigated the changes of mucin O -glycans associated with gut microbiota using a diarrheal post-weaned piglet model. Results We found that diarrhea disrupted the colonic mucus layer and caused aberrant mucin O -glycans, including reduced acidic glycans and truncated glycans, leading to an impaired gut microenvironment. Subsequently, the onset of diarrhea, changes in microbiota and bacterial translocation, resulting in compromised epithelial barrier integrity, enhanced susceptibility to inflammation, and mild growth faltering. Furthermore, we found the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complexes in the diarrheal piglets when compared to the healthy counterparts, triggered the release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and diminished autophagosome formation, specifically the defective conversion of LC3A/B I into LC3A/B II and the accumulation of p62. Additionally, selective blocking of the autophagy pathway by 3-MA led to the reduction in goblet cell-specific gene transcript levels in vitro. Conclusions We observed that diarrheal piglets exhibited colonic microbiota dysbiosis and mucosal barrier dysfunction. Our data demonstrated that diarrhea resulted in the activation of inflammasomes and autophagy restriction along with aberrant mucin O -glycans including reduced acidic glycans and truncated glycans. The results suggested the mucin O-glycans-microbiota axis is likely associated with diarrheal pathogenesis. Our study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of early-weaning-induced diarrheal disease in piglets and potentially understanding of disease mechanisms of diarrhea for human infants. Understanding the molecular pathology and pathogenesis of diarrhea is a prerequisite for the development of novel and effective therapies. Our data suggest that facilitating O -glycan elongation, modifying the microbiota, and developing specific inhibitors to some key inflammasomes could be the options for therapy of diarrhea including human infants. Graphical abstract ","with the in vivo results, we observed that aberrant CMG fermentation also resulted in a significant increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, further highlighting the connection with less developed mucus layer, bacteria, and diarrheal phenotype. Discussion:
 The mucin O-glycan structures are commonly terminated by sulfate, fucose, and sialic acid residues. The terminal display of sialic acid and sulfate sequester pathogens act as binding targets and modulate adhesion. It has been reported that sialic acid residues on mucin can offer a favorable environment and provide a source of nutrients for certain microbes . Terminal residues such as sulfate and Neu5Ac are essential in the enhanced mucus viscosity and structural integrity of the mucus layer , as the removal of terminal Neu5Ac is an initial step in the sequential degradation of mucin glycans . Certain bacteria, known as mucin-degrading bacteria, are capable of digesting glycans by secreting glycosidase enzymes such as sialidases, glycosulfatases, fucosidases, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, and β-galactosidases. It has been reported that sialidases play a key role in the ability of Ruminococcus torques and Fusobacterium to utilize mucins as a nutrient source . A comparative genomic analysis revealed that Ruminococcus torques enabled to cleave 56 glycan structures and utilized MUC2 as a sole carbon source . Continual glycan degradation mediated by glycosidases may lead to the disappearance of host-specific glycan epitopes  and increased host susceptibility to pathogens that lack the mucin-degrading capability. The expansion of pathogens during diarrhea such as E. coli may rely on sialic acid released from mucin glycans catalyzed by sialidases in mucin-degrading bacteria. Our results from the in vitro fermentation demonstrated that reduced terminal sialic acid and sulfate residues paralleled an outgrowth of the increased various pathogens and reduction in the proportions of Ruminococcus torques and Fusobacterium due to loss of the energy source, further confirming a mutualistic relationship between the host glycans and gut microbiota. Mucin sulfation has also been proposed to offer additional protection from luminal insults by increasing mucus viscosity and resistance to bacterial degradation. The physiological significance of mucin sulfation was addressed by increased infiltration of CD45 + inflammatory cells and necrotic lesions as well as hemorrhagic diarrhea in the GlcNaC6ST-2-deficient mice administrated by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)  and pigs infected with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae . Another study used mice deficient in the sulfate transporter NaS1, and found that the mice suffered from an impaired intestinal barrier function and elevated disease activity . We found that O-glycans being terminally sialylated and sulfated were found in lower amounts in the colon of diarrheal piglets, which partially explains defects in the mucus layer and intestinal barrier. Additionally, O-glycans terminating with fucose and sialic acid were found in significantly less abundant in the colon of diarrheal piglets compared to that of the healthy controls. Fucose epitopes are a protective mechanism that protects the host from pathogenic infection by downregulating virulence gene expression of pathogens and inhibiting adherent , this suggests that the decrease in fucose and sialic acid may be another hallmark of gut microbiota dysbiosis."

Timothy grass was grown on replicated experimental plots with one plot receiving 15N-labelled and the other unlabelled N fertilizer. Harvested grass was preserved as dried grass or as formic acid treated or untreated silage. The intact forages and their corresponding N fractions were incubated in buffered rumen fluid in vitro to determine degradation parameters based on the 15N fluxes between labelled feed N and ammonia N pools. A high percentage (25-38%) of 15N-labelled ammonia disappeared from ammonia N pool during the first 15 min of incubation. Microbial uptake of dried grass SN fraction was higher than of silage SN fractions. Fractional degradation rates of SN from formic acid treated silage, untreated silage and dried grass during the first 6 hours of incubation were 0.145, 0.125 and 0.115 /h, respectively. By the end of the incubation period (28 h), 69, 66 and 43%, of the SN fraction of formic acid treated silage, untreated silage and dried grass, respectively were recovered as ammonia.

 Somente uma pequena fração da diversidade microbiana ruminal foi descoberta pelos métodos convencionais de isolamento de microrganismos. A enumeração de espécies microbianas ruminais é difícil com estas técnicas, principalmente, devido a uma grande proporção destes microrganismos não serem cultiváveis . Assim, a descrição do ecossistema baseado nas estirpes isoladas até então é incompleta e podem estar errada Estudos com biologia molecular mostram que gêneros de bactérias ruminais Prevotella ruminicola, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens e Ruminococcus representam grupos filogeneticamente diversos, apesar das espécies destes gêneros aparecerem fenologicamente e bioquimicamente similares . Perspectivas:
 A espécie Streptococcus bovis foi considerada ser a predominante bactéria fermentadora do amido em dietas ricas em amido, mas estudos com primer PCR têm mostrado que o número de Streptococcus bovis não foi afetado quando a base da dieta mudou de forragens para grãos . Conclusões:
 Algumas substâncias encontradas nos alimentos podem interferir no processo fermentativo ruminal, reduzindo muitas vezes a capacidade dos microrganismos em transformar material fibroso, em nutrientes aproveitáveis. Por conseguinte, é importante que o nutricionista, ao propor sistemas de balanceamento nutricional, conheçam os alimentos que serão utilizados para conciliar associações ótimas para os microrganismos do rúmen. Conclusões:
 Nutriente ou misturas alimentares que possuem fatores que podem interferir no processo fermentativo devem ser utilizados com cautela ou restrição, para não afetar o metabolismo ruminal. Conclusões:
 O uso de técnicas biológicas moleculares talvez ajude no entendimento do mecanismo de utilização do alimento no rúmen, como talvez, re-estabeleça um novo cenário da microbiologia do rúmen que pode ser diferente do que tem sido estudado há décadas."

Future experiments will also seek to optimize growth conditions for lignin and lignocellulose degradation for the biological treatment of lignocellulose or lignin waste streams produced by industries that utilize lignocellulose as the feedstock. Discussion:
 Lignin degradation has been measured using several different techniques. 14 C labeled lignin can be used to measures the release of 14 C-carbon dioxide after bacterial growth but this method requires several weeks to prepare the labeled lignin substrate. GC-MS has been used to identify products of microbial growth on kraft lignin and black liquor . The presence of low molecular weight aromatic compounds serves as evidence of lignin degradation. GC-MS was previously used to characterize the ability of P. Discussion:
 glucanolyticus SLM1 to degrade black liquor. In these experiments, P. glucanolyticus SLM1 was grown on cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as the sole carbons source. Anaerobic growth on these substrates produced several organic acids. Oxalic, lactic, acetic, and propanoic acids are mixed acid fermentation products. This metabolic pathway is present in other Paenibacillus species. Malonic, vanillic and gallic acids were only produced when grown on lignin as the sole carbon source confirming our conclusion from analysis of fermentation on black liquor, that these organic acids are produced as a result of lignin degradation. The production of organic acids was also measured throughout bacterial growth; the increase in abundance of these compounds provides additional evidence that the production of oxalic, lactic, acetic, propanoic, malonic, vanillic and gallic acids is not a result of spontaneous degradation during incubation with shaking. Discussion:
 Weight change analysis and GPC were also used to measure lignin degradation. Dry weight of the lignin decreased after bacterial growth suggesting that lignin is being degraded during bacterial growth (Table ). GPC provides further proof of lignin degradation. The chromatographs shown in Fig.  have noticeably larger peaks at increased retention times for the bacterial treated samples when compared to the untreated samples. The presence of these peaks indicates the production of smaller polymers of lignin as a result of bacterial growth. The quantified lignin degradation profiles as presented in Table  demonstrate both the ability of these strains to degrade lignin and the differences in the ability to degrade BCL for P. Discussion:
 glucanolyticus strains SLM1 and 5162 under aerobic and anaerobic culturing conditions. While growth studies showed that P. glucanolyticus 5162 can grow on lignin and lignin-related compounds under aerobic conditions, the GPC results suggest that this strain may not be able to degrade polymeric lignin as efficiently as SLM1 under aerobic conditions. Conclusions:
 These experiments presented in this study evaluated the ability of P. glucanolyticus"

Una proporcion importante de los aminoacidos que llegan al intestino delgado del rumiante proviene de la proteina de la racion. Sin embargo, a diferencia de lo que ocurre en los monogastricos, antes de llegar al intestino delgado esta proteina es sometida a la accion de los microorganismos del rumen. Varios autores (Crooker y col., 1987; Susmel y col., 1989; Erasmus y col., 1994) han observado cambios en el perfil de aminoacidos de la proteina tras su paso por el rumen, aunque los efectos que produce la fermentacion ruminal sobre el perfil de aminoacidos de la proteina de la racion no estan muy claros. La proteina que no ha sido degradada fluye hacia el intestino donde debe ser digerida. De forma similar a lo que ocurre con la degradacion en el rumen, existe poca informacion acerca de como afecta la digestion intestinal a los diferentes aminoacidos que componen una proteina. La incorporacion de valores de degradacion ruminal y digestibilidad intestinal de los aminoacidos individuales de suplementos proteicos permitiria una mejora evidente en la precision de los sistemas de formulacion de raciones para vacuno lechero. La obtencion de valores precisos in vivo es dificil, dada la complejidad de la fermentacion ruminal y la dificultad de controlar los factores de variacion inherentes al animal que pueden confundir la interpretacion de los resultados, por lo que en el presente trabajo se opto por la utilizacion de sistemas in Vitro. El objetivo principal de esta tesis fue la estimacion de la degradabilidad ruminal y la digestibilidad intestinal de los aminoacidos de algunos suplementos proteicos utilizados frecuentemente en vacuno lechero. La tesis se estructura en tres experimentos. En los dos primeros se estudia la degradabilidad ruminal de los aminoacidos de cuatro suplementos proteicos (harina de soja, harina de gluten de maiz, harina de sangre y harina de pescado) mediante un sistema de cultivo continuo de flujo doble. Este sistema in vitro simula el proceso de fermentacion que ocurre en el rumen, y a la vez permite mantener controlados los diversos factores que pueden afectar a la fermentacion ruminal. De esta manera se puede diferenciar el flujo de aminoacidos procedentes de la proteina de la racion que no ha sido degradada en el rumen, y estudiar las posibles variaciones en el perfil de aminoacidos de esta proteina causadas por la fermentacion ruminal. Los resultados de estos dos trabajos muestran que existen diferencias en la degradabilidad ruminal de los aminoacidos individuales de un mismo suplemento proteico, asi como diferencias en la degradabilidad de aminoacidos entre distintos suplementos. No obstante, y a pesar de las estrictas medidas de control aplicadas, la variabilidad obtenida en los resultados no permite establecer valores precisos de degradacion. La falta de una tecnica rapida y fiable para la determinacion de la digestion intestinal no solo de proteinas sino tambien de aminoacidos, es la motivacion del tercer experimento. En la primera parte de este experimento se desarrollo una tecnica capaz de estimar de manera rapida y fiable la digestibilidad intestinal de proteinas y aminoacidos procedentes de suplementos proteicos. Para ello se modifico la tecnica desarrollada por Calsamiglia y Stern (1995) adaptandola a un incubador in Vitro, con tal de agilizar la tecnica y adaptarla al estudio de aminoacidos. Una vez puesta a punto la tecnica, se estimo la digestibilidad intestinal de los aminoacidos procedentes de 11 suplementos proteicos de uso frecuente en vacuno lechero. Los resultados de este experimento muestran diferencias en la digestibilidad intestinal de los aminoacidos dentro de un mismo suplemento. En general, los aminoacidos esenciales se muestran mas digestibles en el intestino que los no esenciales. Asimismo, los resultados reflejan diferencias en la digestion intestinal de aminoacidos entre suplementos proteicos, lo que no permite establecer valores generales de digestibilidad para cada aminoacido, ya que estos pueden diferir en funcion del suplemento proteico estudiado. La tecnica DaisyII desarrollada en este trabajo puede ser un buen metodo para la obtencion de valores de digestibilidad especificos para cada aminoacido de los distintos suplementos proteicos.","parámetros de la fermentación ruminal. Introducción: Dado el amplio rango de datos disponible y la complejidad del diseño experimental se ha creído conveniente dividir esta discusión en dos grandes apartados. Introducción:
 En el primer apartado se presentan varios gráficos que relacionan los resultados de algunos de los parámetros del metabolismo ruminal con la degradación de la proteína de la ración y con la concentración de N amoniacal. En el segundo apartado se realiza una justificación del diseño experimental utilizado, haciendo hincapié en el control de la fermentación ruminal y en el análisis de aminoácidos. 2.1-Efectos de la degradabilidad de la proteína sobre la fermentación ruminal:
 La Figura 1 muestra la evolución de la concentración de N amoniacal en función de la degradación de la proteína de la ración. Como ya se ha comentado, la concentración de N amoniacal es el producto final de la degradación proteica, por lo que cabe esperar que a mayores niveles de degradación de proteína se obtengan mayores concentraciones de N amoniacal. Existen varios trabajos tanto in vivo  como in vitro  que corroboran la reducción en la concentración de N amoniacal como consecuencia de administrar dietas ricas en proteínas protegidas en comparación con el uso de de proteínas degradables en el rumen."

Treatments were: (1) untreated solvent-extracted SBM, (2) amino resin-treated SBM (AR-SBM), and (3) heat-treated SBM (HT-SBM). The experimental design was arranged as a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with 6 fermenters in a dual-flow continuous culture system. Treatments were randomly assigned to fermenters within a Latin square for each period. Each fermenter was fed 106 g/d of diet DM equally distributed in 2 feeding times daily at 0800 and 1800. Diets were formulated to contain 16% CP, 30% NDF, and 30% starch across treatments. The experiment consisted of 3 experimental periods, each lasting for 10 d. The first 7 d of each period were considered adaptation, and the last 3 d were used for sampling and data collection. On d 8 and 9, samples were collected for analysis of diurnal variation in concentrations of NH3-N, pH, and VFA during the first 8 h after feeding. On d 8, 9, and 10, samples were collected from the liquid and solid effluents accumulated over 24 h for analysis of daily averages of NH3-N and VFA pools, and true ruminal digestibility estimates. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS and significance was declared when P ≤ 0.05. The model included the fixed effect of treatment and random effects of square, period, and fermenter within square, while time and interaction treatment × time were included for analyses of diurnal variation, with time as repeated measures. Compared with SBM, the cultured ruminal contents of AR-SBM and HT-SBM had lower NH3-N concentrations, indicating lower microbial fermentation of protein. Molar proportions of isovalerate and isobutyrate were greater in SBM than AR-SBM and HT-SBM, with greater molar proportion of isobutyrate for SBM particularly during the first 2 h after feeding. Flow of NH3-N was greater for SBM compared with AR-SBM and HT-SBM, whereas NAN flow, bacterial N flow, and N efficiency were greater for AR-SBM and HT-SBM compared with SBM. Our results indicate that both the amino resin and heat treatments of SBM allow for similar decrease in microbial degradation of CP without limiting microbial protein synthesis in diets with 16% CP. Amino resin treatment may be effective in reducing microbial fermentation of protein in the rumen without adverse effects on digestibility or fermentation parameters as compared with SBM.

Ruminant N requirements can be divided into N requirements for microbial fermentation and host requirements for amino acids. Ruminant diets often contain non-protein nitrogen (NPN) compounds, a group of components that are not proteins but can be converted to proteins by rumen microbes. Therefore, NPN compounds in ruminant diets serve as alternative sources of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), which is necessary for the synthesis of microbial protein (MCP) in the rumen. MCP is an important component of metabolizable protein for ruminants and, under certain production conditions, may be the only amino acid source for synthesis of tissues and products. In this manner, ruminants utilise NPN compounds without having enzymes for their degradation. The use of NPN compounds in ruminant nutrition allows for an increase in feed consumption and utilisation, as well as the substitution of protein supplements, which in turn leads to more cost-effective production. However, abrupt supplementation or excessive consumption of NPN could negatively affect MCP synthesis, feed digestion, and animal production. On the other hand, it may lead to animal poisoning and the release of large amounts of N into the environment. Knowledge of N metabolism in the rumen, as well as optimization of its utilisation, sets the conditions for the presumed beneficial effects of NPN compounds in ruminant diets, without adverse effects on animal health and the environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to summarize the recent literature data on the metabolism and utilisation of NPN compounds in ruminants.

Degradation of this recalcitrant component of plant biomass is an important process in the global carbon cycle and can potentially provide feedstock for biofuels. Fungi and bacteria are the primary organisms able to breakdown biomass-derived cellulose. Anaerobic bacteria, present in cellulose degrading ecosystems, such as compost piles, soils rich in organic matter, aquatic sediments, and digestive systems of herbivores, have developed efficient pathways to maximize metabolic energy from biomass degradation. In the absence of terminal electron acceptors, such as oxygen, hydrogen-producing pathways are common methods of electron carrier recycling. Electron bifurcating systems linked to hydrogen metabolism play an important role in anaerobic metabolism. In this study, samples from environmental cellulose-degrading microbial communities were collected, and the metabolic products produced during anaerobic cellulose degradation were examined. Samples from different environments produced different fermentation products from cellulose, suggesting flexibility in the fermentative degradation pathways. The most abundant products observed included hydrogen, acetate, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, and methane.","isovalerate, hexanoate, octanoate, ethanol, propanol, butanol, and acetoin were obtained by weighing the appropriate amounts of pure compounds (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Determination of H2, Organic Acids, and Alcohols by Gas Chromatography and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography:
 Common fermentation products not detected with GC-FID analysis were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Media samples (100 μL) were acidified with 0.2 M sulfuric acid, and the concentrations of metabolic products were detected by HPLC (7890 A, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a UV detector (210 nm) using a Aminex HPX-87H column (100 × 7.8 mm, Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Samples (10 μL) were analyzed with 5 mM sulfuric acid as the mobile phase at room temperature over 25 min at 1 mL/min. Standards (10 mM) of formate, succinate, and lactate were obtained by weighing the appropriate amounts of pure compounds (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Ruminococcus albus Growth on Cellulose:
 Growth of R. albus on cellulose was much slower than its growth on glucose . While glucose batch cultures generally grow to full density overnight, the cellulose cultures took approximately 10 days to reach stationary phase (Fig. ). The yellow R. albus cells adhered to the blotting paper substrate (Fig. ).  The extracellular enzyme complexes converted this insoluble substrate to glucans that could then be absorbed by the cell . Glucose cultures, depending on the accumulation of H2 in the headspace, typically produce more acetate than ethanol and in theory the ethanol to acetate ratio maximally reaches 1:1 . Although cellulose is a glucan the R. albus cellulose cultures produced more ethanol than acetate (Fig. ), indicating that additional electron transfer pathways were employed. Overproduction of ethanol has also been observed in previous studies involving R. albus grown on polymeric substrates ). In the rumen, R. albus produces limited ethanol because a methanogenic partner normally keeps the partial pressure of H2 low. This allows R. albus to use the more energy efficient bifurcating hydrogenase system for cofactor recycling (Fig. ; . When R. albus was grown with a small headspace, cellulose degradation and growth was impaired, indicating that the high partial pressure of H2 hampered its ability to degrade cellulose (Figs. )."

It was found that when grown in Sicard's defined medium supplemented with 1% w/v mucin, the organism grew at a rate similar to that in rich medium. The presence of sialate O-acetylesterase activity, an enzyme implicated in glycoprotein degradation, in pneumococcal cell extracts was also reported. The authors hypothesized that neuraminidase A, which is linked to pneumococcal virulence, plays an important role in mucin utilization.

However, the mutant was unable to grow in defined medium containing mucin, indicating the importance of NanA for pneumococcal mucin utilization (Fig. ). Results and discussion:
 Mucin degradation was demonstrated by the amidoblack staining of solidified Sicard's medium with mucin after growth of pneumococcal colonies. Clear zones, demonstrating mucinolytic activity, were visible around colonies of D39 (data not shown). In addition, the size of the colonies grown with mucin was considerably larger than the colonies grown in the absence of mucin (Po 0.05). Results and discussion:

 The fundamentally important process of plant cell wall digestion by ruminants is dependent upon colonisation and digestion within the very complex microbial ecosystem of the rumen . Protozoa, bacteria and fungi are the main components of the microflora involved in this fermentation process . It has been reported that the reduction of particle size (chopping, grinding and pelleting of forages) could increase the relative surface area of forages for enhanced microbial colonisation and consequently the effectiveness of their cell wall degrading enzymes . Although it is recognised that the cellulolytic bacteria are the major contributors to plant cell wall digestion in the rumen , the involvement of anaerobic fungi in this process has also been demonstrated . However, despite the reported capability of these fungi to degrade various lignocellulosic tissues , only limited work on the effects of physical treatment of forages upon fungal growth and their potential degradation have been reported . A higher in vitro fibrolytic activity and thallus development of rumen anaerobic fungi has also been reported when growing on alkali treated barly  or wheat starw . On the other hand,  found that the rate and extent of formate accumulation and loss of substrate dry weight were not significantly different when fungi were grown on milled or unmilled wheat straw. However, rumen conditions are different from those found in in vitro cultures, particularly since the passage of particles correlates with their physical properties such as their size and the specific gravity of the forage . To the best of our knowledge, no information is available yet on the effect of particle size upon in vivo development and activity of anaerobic fungi. Introduction:
 Due to the complex nature of the rumen ecosystem and the difficulty of measuring fungal populations in vivo  quantitative comparisons of fungal biomass in animals is very difficult and none of the various techniques  available for the measurement of rumen fungi are completely satisfactory . Amongst non-photosynthetic microbes, chitin is only found in fungi . Measurement of this polymer has therefore been used to estimate fungal biomass and their growth in vitro  and in vivo . Chitin analysis of different fractionations of strained rumen fluid has also suggested that rumen fungi could be the the main source of chitin content . Introduction:
 The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the mechanical processing (chopping and pelleting) of forage on both the level of chitin in the rumen as a marker of anaerobic fungal population, ruminal fermentation profile and on the rate and extent of straw degradability which may be expected to result in part from fungal activity. Animals and Experimental Design:
 Four sheep each fitted with a rumen fistula (average live weight 42 kg) were used in this study. Sheep were Suffolk wethers and individually kept in metabolism crates with a steel mesh floor panel. Sheep had free access to water and licks of rock salt was always available. Animals and Experimental Design:
 Environmental temperature was maintained at 12-15 o C and artifitial light provided for 14 h a day. Each animal was fed four different diets over four periods in a 4 x 4 Latin square design."

The protein sources used were: soybean meal (SBM); whey protein (WHEY), which was expected to be rapidly degraded, and yeast-derived microbial protein (YMP), which was proposed to be more resistant to rumen degradation. The basal diet was composed of grass silage and a commercial compound feed. The protein supplements were added at three isonitrogenous doses. Fermentation was monitored for 24 hours and gas production, volatile fatty acids, lactic acid, and ammonia were analyzed at three timepoints. Protein degradation was estimated by determining the extent to which branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) introduced with the protein supplement were converted to corresponding branched-chain volatile fatty acids (BCVFA). At the highest dose of WHEY, 60% of introduced valine, leucine, and isoleucine was recovered as isobutyric, 2-methylbutyric, and isovaleric acid (products of BCAA decarboxylation and deamination), respectively. The BCVFA detected represented 50% of added BCAA with SBM, but less than 15% with YMP. Further indications that YMP protein is resistant to degradation were provided by analysis of ammonia. With YMP, the residual ammonia concentration only marginally exceeded that of the cultures with no protein supplementation, while it increased dose-dependently when the vessels were supplemented with WHEY or SBM. This suggests that with WHEY and SBM, the rate of deamination exceeded the rate of ammonia assimilation by bacteria. Residual ammonia and BCVFA, the two indicators of protein fermentation, were strongly correlated. Overall bacterial activity was monitored as yield of gas, volatile fatty acids, and bacteria. These three correlating parameters showed that WHEY only modestly stimulated fermentation, whereas SBM and YMP stimulated fermentation extensively, possibly owing to their higher carbohydrate content. The results presented suggest that the in vitro fermentation method was suitable for detecting differences in resistance of protein supplements to rumen degradation and following a full method validation could be a useful tool for diet formulation. The data obtained suggested that YMP was the most resistant and WHEY the most susceptible to degradation.","stimulate overall rumen fermentation. The chemical composition of YMP appeared to be very different, with readily fermentable carbohydrates capable of stimulating rumen VFA production and highly resistant protein structures which, in vivo, most likely largely escape rumen fermentation. DISCUSSION:
 The results of the study reported here suggest that the approach of following the conversion of BCAA to corresponding BCVFA is an efficient way of monitoring protein degradation by rumen bacteria. In this study, the herd used as a source of rumen fluid had no previous history of feeding the protein sources tested. Thus, the microbiota used as an inoculum was not adapted to degradation of any test protein supplement, eliminating a potential experimental bias. To validate the methodological approach further studies should be conducted using multiple cows as sources of rumen fluid for assessment of animalto-animal variation. Also, the results of the in vitro method described here should be compared with the results of an in vivo methodological approach, using exactly the same protein supplements. The relative differences in the resistance of the three protein supplements in the present study were substantial and followed the expected ranking for degradability. Even if the method described in this paper would not give the absolute percent degradability in the rumen, it is accurate when the purpose is to rank protein products, plant varieties, production processes, etc. for protein degradability. A ranking tool would help those formulating diets to meet protein requirements of cows in different conditions or phase of lactation. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

"The biochemical and microbiological characteristics of rumen fluid from cattle co-grazed with and without camels as compared to that from the foregut of camels","https://scispace.com/paper/the-biochemical-and-microbiological-characteristics-of-rumen-4l75zyx4ms","2014","Dissertation","","Iswan Suyub","10.14264/UQL.2015.535","https://scispace.com/pdf/the-biochemical-and-microbiological-characteristics-of-rumen-4l75zyx4ms.pdf","Co-grazing is a common practice under many range conditions. The main advantage of co-grazing is to fully utilize the vegetation sources by taking advantage of the different preferences among animals towards plant species and parts. Hence, this study aimed to establish if co-grazing camels with cattle would lead to changes in the biochemical characteristics in the rumen contents of cattle, and result in different fermentation end products. Rumen contents were collected from two groups of animals at two different locations, the Runnymede Cattle Station at Richmond in northern Queensland, and the Meramist abattoir at Caboolture in Queensland. For the Richmond site, two groups of animals were sampled via stomach tube; cattle co-grazed with camels (n=6) and cattle grazed alone (n=6). For the Caboolture site, foregut contents from three groups of animals were sampled post mortem; camels co-grazed with cattle (n=6), cattle co-grazed with camels (n=6), and camels grazed alone (n=6). The ratios of camel to cattle for the Richmond and the Caboolture sites were 1:49 and 1:14 respectively. These ratios were considered adequate for microbial transfer to occur. Foregut fluid samples from all animals were used to inoculate a pre-reduced medium containing Mitchell grass (Astrebla lappacea), Flinders grass (Iseilema spp.), or Lucerne hay (Medicago sativa). Measurements of gas production, volatile fatty acids, and dry matter digestibility were carried out following 48 or 96 h of in vitro incubation at 39 °C. Inocula from cattle co-grazed with camels from Richmond resulted in greater (P< 0.05) dry matter digestibility for Mitchell grass than cattle grazed alone and produced greater (P< 0.05) amounts of n-butyrate. On the other hand, inocula of camels co-grazed with cattle from Caboolture had higher in vitro dry matter digestibility for Mitchell grass and shared the potential for higher dry matter digestibility with cattle co-grazed with camels for lucerne hay. Camels co-grazed with cattle also produced more (P<0.05) n-Butyric acid in the Mitchell grass treatment compared to groups of camels grazed alone and cattle co-grazed with camels. The results from the biochemical analysis suggested that co-grazing may change the ecosystem of the foregut in a number of beneficial ways. A microbiological analysis was carried out to investigate the structure of the bacterial community in each group of animals with high throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA gene using 454 pyrosequencing technology. Using an open source software computational program provided by Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME), not only was it possible to identify all microbial species within the foregut fluid samples but also it was possible for all data to be analysed and compared systematically. Further analyses to identify the different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a similarity threshold of 97% allowed the assessment of observed species (OTUs); species richness (Chao1); and phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree metric for each foregut fluid sample. These analyses were sensitive enough to reveal both species abundance and species taxonomic or phylogenetic distances. Moreover, bacterial differences were also revealed at the phyla, family, and OTU levels. A distinct pattern of the percentage of bacterial distribution evaluated at family taxonomical level was observed among the animal groups. In cattle co-grazed with camels from Richmond, Bacteroidales were the most abundant bacteria found (36%) while in cattle grazed alone Bacteroidales made up only 28%of the bacterial population. However, cattle grazed alone from Richmond had a higher percentage of Lachnospiraceae (19%) compared to cattle co-grazed with camels with only a 10% Lachnospiraceae population. At the Caboolture site, camels grazed alone had the lowest Bacteroidales (20%) whilst the highest population was found in cattle co-grazed with camels (38%). In the group of camels co-grazed with cattle this group of bacteria accounted for 33%, which was lower than cattle co-grazed with camels. Prevotellaceae was highest in camels grazed alone (34%) and lower for camels co-grazed with cattle (26%). The lowest Prevotellaceae percentage was found in cattle co-grazed with camels at only 8%. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was also used to evaluate the samples. PCoA was performed by using the phylogenetic composition-base to plot each sample into one or more clusters so that a distance matrix measurement of variation could be constructed to reflect the corresponding dissimilarities of sample community membership or community structure. A clear clustering of all samples within its group was observed in PCoA analysis, which revealed a clear difference between groups of animals for both samples from the Richmond and the Caboolture sites. These findings support the hypothesis that the GI tract is an interchange platform where adaptable microbial groups undergo a state of continuous replacement by functional bacterial species associated with changes in the environment. There is, however the possibility of indirect environmental contamination which might also be a factor influencing the occurrence of bacterial OTUs in multiple host species. Thus, additional research is needed to expand the investigations into all factors that are involved in the transformation that takes place in the foregut environment.","shown in many ruminal microorganisms, ruminal bacteria have remained the major source of peptidase activity, specifically towards oligopeptides (Figure .1) plus, bacterial peptidases exist both extracellularly and intracellularly . Protein metabolism by rumen bacteria:
 The excess amount of ammonia produced is mostly absorbed across the rumen wall where it is transported to the liver and then converted to urea and excreted. Some of the ammonia is recycled in saliva . The loss of protein N excreted as urea can be more than 25%, which can have a detrimental affect on the overall economics of ruminant production ). However, the extent of N build up may vary with different diets ) and with the rate at which proteins are being degraded . Apart from those listed in Figure .1, isolates of Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium aminophilum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius have been found to be significantly involved in ammonia production . Ammonia utilisation as a nitrogen source by the bacteria only works if there is a sufficient supply of ATP for microbial protein synthesis . Protein metabolism by rumen bacteria:
 It is also quite common to observe an inverse relationship between the starch content of feed and the concentration of ammonia in rumen .  . Rumen fungi:
 Fungi are strict anaerobes whose life cycle consists of a motile phase as a zoospore and a vegetative phase as a sporangium ). Establishment of fungi happens during the vegetative phase as they consume feed particles using rhizoids, a cell wall penetration mechanism . Approximately 8% of ruminal microbial biomass comprises of rumen fungi ). An estimation of the rumen fungal population size can only be obtained by zoospore count in ruminal fluid as it is difficult to quantify the vegetative stages . Rumen fungi:
 However, development of oligonucleotide probes has enabled researchers to quantify the contribution of ruminal fungal protein to the ruminal non-ammonia nitrogen (NAN) Rumen fungi:
 and their flow to the duodenum of sheep . Rumen fungi:
 Ruminal fungi have demonstrated the ability to utilise most polysaccharides and soluble sugars. However, some carbohydrates including arabinose, pectin, polygalacturonic acid, galactose, and mannose, are not utilised. Fungi appear to degrade the plant cuticle, which acts as a protective barrier on the outside leaf and stem surfaces . This feature entitles fungi to be considered to play a distinctive role in digestion in the rumen as they have access to plant polysaccharides which are otherwise unavailable to cellulolytic bacteria. Cellulase and hemicellulase make up the remainder of this extremely active arsenal of ruminal fungal enzymes ."

 A otimização na utilização do nitrogênio dietético pelos ruminantes iniciase com a formulação da dieta, especialmente visando sua composição em termos de nitrogênio (PB), energia e outros nutrientes, além do comportamento da dieta no trato digestivo do animal em termos da sua digestibilidade, produção de ácidos graxos voláteis, síntese de proteína microbiana e outros processos metabólicos . Dinâmica do Nitrogênio Ruminal:
 O estabelecimento de condições sob as quais a fermentação ruminal será otimizada requer o entendimento das exigências de nutrientes para a população microbiana. A digestão de proteína no rúmen resulta na produção de peptídeos. Estes serão mais tarde hidrolisados a aminoácidos, os quais poderão ser deaminados, produzindo amônia. Todas as maiores comunidades microbianas do rúmen (bactérias, protozoários e fungos) podem hidrolisar proteína e usar os produtos finais como fontes de N para crescimento . Assim, a degradação ruminal de proteína (proteólise) determina a produção de N amoniacal, aminoácidos, peptídeos e ácidos graxos de cadeia ramificada, os quais influenciam diretamente a taxa de crescimento microbiano no rúmen. A taxa e extensão da proteólise ruminal não somente afeta a síntese de proteína microbiana mas também a quantidade e qualidade da proteína dietética não degradável que alcança o duodeno . Dinâmica do Nitrogênio Ruminal:
 Os microrganismos ruminais geralmente contém 20 a 60% proteína bruta na matéria seca. As fontes de nitrogênio usadas pelos microrganismos para síntese protéica consistem de peptídeos e aminoácidos, resultantes da hidrólise de proteínas, e do nitrogênio não protéico, principalmente amônia . O crescimento microbiano pode ser afetado pela disponibilidade dos fatores que compõem as exigências nutricionais dos microrganismos do rúmen, como carboidratos, amônia, peptídeos, aminoácidos, enxofre e ácidos graxos voláteis de cadeia ramificada ."

While rumen bacterial populations have been well documented, only a fraction of the rumen eukarya are taxonomically and functionally characterized, despite the recognition that they contribute to the cellulolytic phenotype of the rumen microbiota. To investigate how anaerobic fungi actively engage in digestion of recalcitrant fiber that is resistant to degradation, we resolved genome-centric metaproteome and metatranscriptome datasets generated from switchgrass samples incubated for 48 h in nylon bags within the rumen of cannulated dairy cows. Across a gene catalog covering anaerobic rumen bacteria, fungi and viruses, a significant portion of the detected proteins originated from fungal populations. Intriguingly, the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) profile suggested a domain-specific functional specialization, with bacterial populations primarily engaged in the degradation of hemicelluloses, whereas fungi were inferred to target recalcitrant cellulose structures via the detection of a number of endo- and exo-acting enzymes belonging to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5, 6, 8, and 48. Notably, members of the GH48 family were amongst the highest abundant CAZymes and detected representatives from this family also included dockerin domains that are associated with fungal cellulosomes. A eukaryote-selected metatranscriptome further reinforced the contribution of uncultured fungi in the ruminal degradation of recalcitrant fibers. These findings elucidate the intricate networks of in situ recalcitrant fiber deconstruction, and importantly, suggest that the anaerobic rumen fungi contribute a specific set of CAZymes that complement the enzyme repertoire provided by the specialized plant cell wall degrading rumen bacteria.","detection of proteins associated to the fungal population was higher in switchgrass fiber comp a r e dt or u m e nfluid, the opposite was observed for proteins associated to the abovementioned Prevotella clade (Supplementary Fig. ). Toward a holistic understanding of the functional roles of rumen populations:
 Seen in context with the high detection level of fungal enzymes for cellulose decomposition, this emphasizes that a key role of anaerobic fungi during this phase of the biomass degradation (48 h) is likely to function in recalcitrant fiber degradation of lignin-enriched fiber residues, whereas bacteria encompass a wider functional repertoire, including degradation of more easily digestible fibers and fermentation. Conclusions:
 While our understanding of the rumen microbiome has increased significantly in recent years, the majority of this knowledge has been restricted to the bacterial population. Conclusions:
 Insights into the role of anaerobic rumen fungi have been limited to a few studies and still very little is known about the overall ecology of anaerobic rumen fungi as part of the rumen microbiome and their contribution to the biomassdegrading process in the native habitat. Conclusions:
 In the current study, we report a time-dependent scenario within the rumen ecosystem where bacteria appear to have occupied multiple functional niches, while anaerobic fungi seem to dictate the degradation of resilient lignocellulosic plant material. Conclusions:
 Here, members of the GH family GH48 were detected at elevated levels and appeared to come nearly exclusively from the rumen fungi. Conclusions:
 Furthermore, it appears as if the bacterial population in the rumen is primarily involved in degradation of hemicellulose, at least for plant material that has been incubated in the rumen for 48 h. Conclusions:
 Overall, these results suggest that anaerobic fungi have a strongly adherent phenotype and colonize recalcitrant plant cell wall material that is likely too large in dimension/particle size to pass out of the rumen. Conclusions:
 Furthermore, we speculate that their adherent strategy is to maintain their population size in the rumen and prevent them from being washed out, given that they grow slower than the general rumen turnover rate. Conclusions:
 Although these results broaden our understanding of the native function of anaerobic rumen fungi, spatial and temporal experiments would certainly be beneficial to provide further support of the hypothesis that the detected proteins are ubiquitously involved in the degradation of recalcitrant biomass in the rumen and are essential to the nutrition and well-being of their host animal.

INTRODUCCIÓN:
 Una de las alternativas que ha generado mucho interés es el uso de extractos de plantas naturales, reconocidos como sustancias seguras para el consumo humano (GRAS, generally recognized as safe, . Aunque existen algunos estudios antiguos que observaron cambios en la fermentación ruminal por efecto de aceites esenciales ) o de saponinas , existe muy poca información de los efectos de otros extractos de plantas sobre las poblaciones microbianas ruminales, así como de sus mecanismos de acción y las dosis óptimas que permitan manipular la fermentación ruminal. GENERALIDADES DE LA NUTRICION EN RUMIANTES:
 El rumiante establece una relación simbiótica estrecha con los microorganismos que habitan en el rumen. El rumen es el hábitat ideal para el crecimiento de los microorganismos ruminales. El rumiante funcional proporciona alimento masticado y un medio líquido anaeróbico altamente reductor , con temperatura y pH adecuado para los microorganismos . A cambio, los microorganismos digieren los nutrientes aportando ácidos grasos volátiles (AGV), y proteína microbiana de alta calidad . GENERALIDADES DE LA NUTRICION EN RUMIANTES:
 La optimización de la producción del rumiante requiere el mantenimiento de las condiciones adecuadas del medio ruminal que garanticen el equilibrio y buen funcionamiento del ecosistema. FERMENTACION RUMINAL:
 Existe abundante información sobre las características del medio ruminal  y las funciones de las bacterias ruminales , de los protozoos  y de los procesos fermentativos ruminales . FERMENTACION RUMINAL:
 Al constituir un sistema abierto y continuo, el rumen aporta el volumen y el tiempo de retención necesario para que el alimento ingerido por el animal sea degradado y fermentado por los microorganismos ruminales. Este ambiente acuoso proporciona las condiciones precisas para que las interacciones entre las actividades microbianas ruminales, las enzimas producidas por los mismos microorganismos y los nutrientes, sean óptimas . Los microorganismos ruminales se encargan de degradar los carbohidratos y las proteínas de forma total o parcial a monómeros para su fermentación o absorción  con el objetivo principal de obtener energía y proteína microbiana . FERMENTACION RUMINAL:
 La proteína microbiana constituye el aporte principal de proteína al rumiante, y se digiere y absorbe por la vaca para su utilización metabólica ."

 The rumen is the most studied organ regarding the symbiotic interaction between host and microbiota in the digestive tract of ruminants. It may be the organ of greatest metabolic adaptability due to the presence of large and complex pre-gastric microflora. Thus, it plays a vital role in nutritional and physiological functions; besides, along with the intestines, it performs protective and immune functions in the host. Introduction:
 Virginiamycin is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic combination, a product from the fermentation of several species of Streptomyces sp., of which Streptomyces virginiae is the main one. It consists of two main components: virginiamycin factor M1 and virginiamycin factor S1, which are synergistic and have microbial activity. This non-ionophore antibiotic acts by binding with ribosomes, inhibiting protein synthesis of certain microorganisms  . Introduction:
 The salinomycin fits into another category of additive. It is classified as an ionophore additive, which is a polyesters carboxylic antibiotic; it is a product of the fermentation of various Streptomyces sp. strains. They are considered lipophilic substances, which are toxic to many bacteria and protozoa. By being a substance that acts in the selection of microorganisms, depressing or inhibiting their growth, it is used in ruminant nutrition with the aim of improving performance  . Introduction:
 In view of the foregoing, the present experiment was conducted with the purpose of evaluating the inclusion of the additives virginiamycin and salinomycin to the mineral supplement for beef cattle fed tropical grass based diet during the rainy period. We evaluated supplement intake, weight gain performance, biometric measurements, and body condition score. Besides, the economic impact of this inclusion on growing beef cattle and its effects on ruminal pH, we also evaluated ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations and in situ degradability of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) FERREIRA, S.F. et al.

 To perform this experiment, the research project was submitted to the Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG-COEP). The project was approved and registered under the protocol number COEP-UFG 039/11. The methods and procedures used in this study were performed according to the standards of the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA). Material and Methods:
 Three treatments were set: control treatment, mineral supplement only (COMIGO -CRIA 61 -F.2) (MS); virginiamycin treatment, MS plus virginiamycin (PhiGrow® -20g/kg); and salinomycin treatment, MS plus salinomycin (Posistac® -18g/kg)."

Cellulose degradation requires a suite of enzymes including endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases. The enzymes employed by R. albus 8 in degrading cellulose are yet to be completely elucidated. Through bioinformatic analysis of a draft genome sequence of R. albus 8, seventeen putatively cellulolytic genes were identified. The genes were heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. On biochemical analysis with cellulosic substrates, seven of the gene products (Ra0185, Ra0259, Ra0325, Ra0903, Ra1831, Ra2461 and Ra2535) were identified as endoglucanases, releasing predominantly cellobiose and cellotriose. Each of the R. albus 8 endoglucanases, except for Ra0259 and Ra0325, bound to the model crystalline cellulose Avicel, confirming functional carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). The polypeptides for Ra1831 and Ra2535 were found to contain distantly related homologs of CBM65. Mutational analysis of residues within the CBM65 of Ra1831 identified key residues required for binding. Phylogenetic analysis of the endoglucanases revealed three distinct subfamilies of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5). Our results demonstrate that this fibrolytic bacterium uses diverse GH5 catalytic domains appended with different CBMs, including novel forms of CBM65, to degrade cellulose.","Title: Functional and modular analyses of diverse endoglucanases from Ruminococcus albus 8, a specialist plant cell wall degrading bacterium Authors: Michael Iakiviak,Saravanan Devendran,Anna Skorupski,Young Hwan Moon,Roderick I Mackie,Isaac Cann (Corresponding Author)"

Five sets of gas production data consisting of 216 curves, obtained using a wide range of feeds (including straw, hay, silage, grain and various byproducts), were analysed to study the performance of these gas production models. Application of the non-sigmoidal models (simple Mitscherlich and Michaelis–Menten) to the data resulted in convergence problems and these models were found to be inadequate in many cases. Based on results of a pairwise comparison between models (variance ratio test), ranking of residual mean squares, lack-of-fit test, and of analyses of residuals, the generalized Mitscherlich and the generalized Michaelis–Menten models seemed particularly suited because of their flexibility to encompass sigmoidal and non-sigmoidal shapes of gas production profiles, whether symmetrical or not.","Title: Estimating the extent of degradation of ruminant feeds from a description of their gas production profiles observed in vitro: comparison of models Authors: M S Dhanoa,S Lopez,J Dijkstra,D R Davies,R Sanderson,B A Williams,Z Sileshi,J France (Corresponding Author) Keywords: Rumen: Mathematical models: Gas production: Feed degradation Abbreviations: E, extent of ruminal degradation, EXP, exponential, GEXP, generalized Mitscherlich, GMM, generalized Michaelis-Menten, GOMP, Gompertz, LOG, logistic, MM, Michaelis-Menten, OM, organic matter, RMS, residual mean squares, rMSPE, root mean square prediction error, S 0 , potentially degradable fraction of the feed, VFA, volatile fatty acids, Y, yield factor relating gas produced to substrate degraded"

 the ideal would be a method which would be able to estimate with a reasonable accuracy in vivo digestibility, without the need of conducting a conventional trial, since it is extremely tiring and limited in its use, when there is a need for fast responses. Introduction:
 The in situ degradability technique has been adopted by the AFRC (1992) as a standard method of characterization of the ruminal degradability of nitrogen, being able to be utilized to report the characteristic degradation of dietary fibers  http://dx.doi.org/10.  and protein . The use of this technique has the advantage to provide a fast and simple estimate of nutrient degradation in the rumen, in addition to enabling the accompanying of this over time . Introduction:
 Evaluating a possible relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable is a common task in statistic analyses and may be done through regression models, which according to Draper and Smith (1998), can be linear, linearizable and non-linear. The studies of growth of animal and plants, as well as the nutrient degradation studies over time are reported by non-linear, presenting some difficulties in the process of estimating parameters. Introduction:
 The models developed to report the digestive events occurring in the rumen are numerous; some approach the quantification of total or partial processes of ruminal digestion and others are complex models of simulation which regard rumen in a global way. At present, two sorts of interest are realized which demand the evaluation of digestibility of a forage plant. The former is the need to compare different forage plants, by taking into account that the most digestible will show better economical/productive return by the animals which consume it, and the latter is the formulation of mechanistic models which express progressively and truly the dynamic phenomenon of digestion considering the circumstantial factors inherent to feeds such as composition, amount, feeding frequency and son on."

Los valores de degradación del Nt oscilaron entre 90 y 68 %, al utilizar diferentes constantes de recambio ruminal, lo que da la medida de la influencia marcada que, desde el punto de vista fisiológico, cumple la velocidad de pasaje en el aprovechamiento del nitrógeno dietario, por parte de los microorganismos del rumen.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which intestinal γδ T cells interact with the gut microbiota to maintain tolerance.We found that antibiotic treatment impaired oral tolerance and depleted intestinal γδ T cells, suggesting that the gut microbiota is necessary to maintain γδ T cells. We also found that mice deficient for γδ T cells (γδ-/-) had an altered microbiota composition that led to small intestine (SI) immune dysregulation and impaired tolerance. Accordingly, colonizing WT mice with γδ-/- microbiota resulted in SI immune dysregulation and loss of tolerance whereas colonizing γδ-/- mice with WT microbiota normalized mucosal immune responses and restored mucosal tolerance. Moreover, we found that SI γδ T cells shaped the gut microbiota and regulated intestinal homeostasis by secreting the fecal micro-RNA let-7f. Importantly, oral administration of let-7f to γδ-/- mice rescued mucosal tolerance by promoting the growth of the γδ-/--microbiota-depleted microbe Ruminococcus gnavus.Taken together, we demonstrate that γδ T cell-selected microbiota is necessary and sufficient to promote mucosal tolerance, is mediated in part by γδ T cell secretion of fecal micro-RNAs, and is mechanistically linked to restoration of mucosal immune responses.

Thus, decreased R. gnavus rather than increased P. excrementihominis in γδ −/− mice is associated with impaired oral tolerance in these mice. Ruminococcus gnavus restores oral tolerance in γδ −/− mice:
 We then investigated immune effects associated with restoration of oral tolerance by R. gnavus in γδ −/− mice. As shown in Fig. , there are decreased Tregs and increased Th17 cells in the SILP of γδ −/− mice and we found that R. gnavus colonization normalized these frequencies. Consistent with this, we found that R. gnavus colonization also restored cDC1 migratory properties to the mLN (Fig. ). To investigate whether colonizing γδ −/− mice with R. gnavus restored IL-10 production by CX3CR1 + MNPs, we treated IL-10-GFP mice with ABX for 3 days and then colonized mice with WT, γδ −/− or γδ −/− microbiota + R. gnavus. Consistent with our findings shown in Fig. , IL-10 production by CX3CR1 + MNPs was reduced in mice transferred with γδ −/− microbiota, but IL-10 levels were restored when IL-10-GFP mice received γδ −/− microbiota + R. gnavus (Fig.  ). Thus, R. gnavus rescues mucosal tolerance in γδ −/− mice by restoring intestinal homeostasis. Ruminococcus gnavus regulates intestinal mucus layer:
 It has been demonstrated that the intestinal epithelial barrier is critical for oral tolerance and that microbial adherence plays an important role in gut homeostasis . Microbial adherence promotes IL-10 production by CX3CR1 + MNPs, which plays an important role in Treg/Th17 balance . A critical factor that regulates microbial adherence to the gut epithelium is the mucus. A thick mucus layer affects the interaction between microbes and intestinal epithelial cells . Because R. gnavus is a mucus degrader and because it is reduced in γδ −/− microbiota, we hypothesized that γδ −/− mice would develop a thicker mucus layer and that this thicker layer would impair mucosal tolerance. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed histological analysis of small intestine of γδ −/− mice using periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), a mucus staining compound. We found that γδ −/− mice have a thicker mucus layer as compared to WT mice (Supplemental Fig. ). Moreover, colonization of γδ −/− mice with R. gnavus normalized the mucus layer thickness (Supplemental Fig. ). These results were further confirmed by staining γδ −/− mouse small intestine with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a carbohydrate-binding lectin with high affinity for sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, which are mucus constituents (Supplemental Fig. )."

A 4 x 4 latin square design was used, in which the treatments were composed by the concentrates, adjusted for daily body weight gain (BWG) of 0.5 and 1 kg/animal and potential microbial fermentation (y) of 9.5 and 11 g microbial crude protein/MJ fermentable metabolizable energy. No differences were observed for pH, molar concentration of acetic and butyric acids, molar proportion of acetic, propionic and butyric acids and acetic:propionic ratio. There were differences between diets for the different potential microbial fermentations for ammonia level, 14.67 and 20.83 mg/100 mL for low and high, respectively, and for molar concentration of propionic acid, differed between the different potentials for weight gain, 7.62 and 8.94 mM, respectively, for low and high weight gain. There were no differences among diets for the degradability fractions of palisedagrass hay and soybean grain. There were difference in parameter ""b"" and effective degradability at 5%/hour of CP for the potential BWG of corn grain. There was significant interaction between potential BWG and potential microbial fermentation for some parameters of DM and CP of soybean meal, the same was observed for cottonseed meal.

Material e Métodos:
 As médias foram estudadas em esquema de quadrado latino 4 × 4 (animais × períodos), com quatro tratamentos no modelo fatorial 2 × 2 (GPC × y). O modelo também incluiu o fator horário de coleta como causa adicional de variação no caso da avaliação de parâmetros com medidas repetidas no tempo. Foi realizada análise de variância por meio do teste F a 5% de probabilidade . Resultados e Discussão:
 Não foram encontradas interações significativas (P>0,05) entre os potenciais de ganho de peso e de fermen-tação microbiana para todas as variáveis de fermentação ruminal estudadas (Tabela 3). Com exceção da diferença (P<0,05) da concentração molar (mM) de ácido propiônico nos diferentes potenciais de GPC e da diferença (P<0,05) na concentração da NH 3 entre os diferentes potenciais de fermentação ruminal, não foram observadas outras diferenças significativas (P>0,05) entre tratamentos nos demais parâmetros avaliados. Para elevar o potencial de fermentação, foi necessário prover maior quantidade de proteína degradável no rúmen (PDR), que, em última instância, foi convertida em NH 3 . No caso do ácido propiônico, o padrão de fermentação propiciado pelo maior nível de concentrado favoreceu a produção deste AGV."
