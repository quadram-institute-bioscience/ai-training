In this work we have obtained and analyzed the draft genome sequence of another R. gnavus mucin-degrader, ATCC 35913, isolated from a healthy individual. Transcriptomics analyses of both ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 strains confirmed that the strategy utilized by R. gnavus for mucin-degradation is focused on the utilization of terminal mucin glycans. R. gnavus ATCC 35913 also encodes a predicted IT-sialidase and harbors a Nan cluster dedicated to sialic acid utilization. We showed that the Nan cluster was upregulated when the strains were grown in presence of mucin. In addition we demonstrated that both R. gnavus strains were able to grow on 2,7-anyhydro-Neu5Ac, the IT-sialidase transglycosylation product, as a sole carbon source. Taken together these data further support the hypothesis that IT-sialidase expressing gut microbes, provide commensal bacteria such as R. gnavus with a nutritional competitive advantage, by accessing and transforming a source of nutrient to their own benefit."

The species Ruminococcus gnavus is present in the digestive tract of ≥90% of humans and has been implicated in gut-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Here we analysed the ability of two R. gnavus human strains, E1 and ATCC 29149, to utilize host glycans. We showed that although both strains could assimilate mucin monosaccharides, only R. gnavus ATCC 29149 was able to grow on mucin as a sole carbon source. Comparative genomic analysis of the two R. gnavus strains highlighted potential clusters and glycoside hydrolases (GHs) responsible for the breakdown and utilization of mucin-derived glycans. Transcriptomic and functional activity assays confirmed the importance of specific GH33 sialidase, and GH29 and GH95 fucosidases in the mucin utilisation pathway. Notably, we uncovered a novel pathway by which R. gnavus ATCC 29149 utilises sialic acid from sialylated substrates. Our results also demonstrated the ability of R. gnavus ATCC 29149 to produce propanol and propionate as the end products of metabolism when grown on mucin and fucosylated glycans. These new findings provide molecular insights into the strain-specificity of R. gnavus adaptation to the gut environment advancing our understanding of the role of gut commensals in health and disease."

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut …","Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)) is commonly found in the terminal location of colonic mucin glycans where it is a much-coveted nutrient for gut bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus. R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut microbiota in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease."

We previously showed that the ability of R. gnavus to forage on mucins is strain-dependent and associated with sialic acid metabolism. Here, we showed that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free (GF) mice. Changes in metabolites associated with brain function such as tryptamine, indolacetate, and trimethylamine N-oxide were also detected in the cecal content of Rg-mice when compared to GF mice. Next, we investigated the effect of R. gnavus monocolonization on hippocampus cell proliferation and behavior. We observed a significant decrease of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Rg-mice as compared to GF mice and recruitment of phagocytic microglia in the vicinity. Behavioral assessments suggested an improvement of the spatial working memory in Rg-mice but no change in other cognitive functions. These results were also supported by a significant upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and neuroplasticity. Collectively, these data provide first insights into how R. gnavus metabolites may influence brain regulation and function through modulation of granule cell development and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus. This work has implications for further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the role of R. gnavus in neurological disorders."

Although several microbial species have been identified as mucin degraders, there are likely many other members of the healthy gut community with the capacity to degrade mucins. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota. Within the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all Akkermansia glycaniphila and muciniphila genomes harbored multiple gene copies of mucin-degrading GHs. The only representative of the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victivallales, harbored a GH profile that closely mirrored Akkermansia. In the Actinobacteria phylum, we found several Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species with mucin-degrading GHs. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermenitomonas Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species had mucin degrading GHs. Firmicutes contained Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species with mucin-degrading GHs. Interestingly, far fewer mucin-degrading GHs were observed in the Proteobacteria phylum and were found in Klebsiella, Mixta, Serratia and Enterobacter species. We confirmed the mucin-degrading capability of 23 representative gut microbes using a chemically defined media lacking glucose supplemented with porcine intestinal mucus. These data greatly expand our knowledge of microbial-mediated mucin degradation within the human gut microbiota. "

The molecular cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the gut play an important role in the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis and general health. Here, we studied the impact of a major Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells.

Methods and Results
Our results showed that R. gnavus E1 specifically increases the expression and the glycosylation level of the intestinal glyco-conjugates by goblet cells in the colonic mucosa of mono-associated mice with R. gnavus E1 as well as in human HT29-MTX cells. Such an effect was mediated through induction of the level of mRNA encoding for the major intestinal gel-forming mucin such as MUC2 and various glycosyltransferase enzymes.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time that R. gnavus E1 possess the ability to modulate the glycosylation profile of the glyco-conjugate molecules and mucus in goblet cells.

Significance and Impact of the Study
Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. gnavus E1 modified specifically the glycosylation pattern and MUC2 expression by means of a small soluble factor of peptidic nature (<3 kDa) and heat stable in the HT29-MTX cell."

Here, we focused on two major human gut symbionts, the mucin-degrader Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149, and R. bromii L2-63, a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch (RS) in human colon. Using anaerobic individual and co-cultures of R. bromii and R. gnavus grown on mucin or starch as sole carbon source, we showed that starch degradation by R. bromii supported the growth of R. gnavus whereas R. bromii did not benefit from mucin degradation by R. gnavus. Further we analyzed the growth (quantitative PCR), metabolite production (1H NMR analysis), and bacterial transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) of R. bromii cultured with RS or soluble starch (SS) in the presence or absence of R. gnavus. In co-culture fermentations on starch, 1H NMR analysis showed that R. gnavus benefits from transient glucose and malto-oligosaccharides released by R. bromii upon starch degradation, producing acetate, formate, and lactate as main fermentation end-products. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) on starch (SS and RS) showed that the presence of R. bromii induced changes in R. gnavus transcriptional response of genes encoding several maltose transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism such as maltose phosphorylase, in line with the ability of R. gnavus to utilize R. bromii starch degradation products. In the RS co-culture, R. bromii showed a significant increase in the induction of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes and a decrease of vitamin B12 (VitB12)-dependent methionine biosynthesis as compared to the mono-culture, suggesting that Trp and VitB12 availability become limited in the presence of R. gnavus. Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R. gnavus population inhabiting the mucus niche may be modulated by the supply of non-digestible carbohydrates reaching the colon such as RS."

This prompted renewed interest in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of R. gnavus to the gut, and the molecular mediators affecting its association with health and disease. From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the biological characterisation of R. gnavus, its occurrence in the infant and adult gut microbiota and the factors influencing its colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract; we also discuss the current state of our knowledge on its role in host health and disease. We highlight gaps in knowledge and discuss the hypothesis that differential health outcomes associated with R. gnavus in the gut are strain and niche specific."

RgNanH comprises a GH33 catalytic domain and a sialic acid-binding carbohydrate-binding module (CBM40). Here we used glycan arrays, STD NMR, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis and binding assays to determine the structure and function of RgNanH_CBM40 (RgCBM40). RgCBM40 displays the canonical CBM40 β-sandwich fold and broad specificity towards sialoglycans with millimolar binding affinity towards α2,3- or α2,6-sialyllactose. RgCBM40 binds to mucus produced by goblet cells and to purified mucins, providing direct evidence for a CBM40 as a novel bacterial mucus adhesin. Bioinformatics data show that RgCBM40 canonical type domains are widespread among Firmicutes. Furthermore, binding of R. gnavus ATCC 29149 to intestinal mucus is sialic acid mediated. Together, this study reveals novel features of CBMs which may contribute to the biogeography of symbiotic bacteria in the gut."

However, MD bacterial physiology and metabolism remain elusive. Here, we assessed functional modules of mucin catabolism, through a comprehensive bioinformatics-aided functional annotation, to identify 54 A. muciniphila genes and 296 R. gnavus genes. The reconstructed core metabolic pathways coincided with the growth kinetics and fermentation profiles of A. muciniphila and R. gnavus grown in the presence of mucin and its constituents. Genome-wide multi-omics analyses validated the nutrient-dependent fermentation profiles of the MD bacteria and identified their distinct mucolytic enzymes. The distinct metabolic features of the two MD bacteria induced differences in the metabolite receptor levels and inflammatory signals of the host immune cells. In addition, in vivo experiments and community-scale metabolic modeling demonstrated that different dietary intakes influenced the abundance of MD bacteria, their metabolic fluxes, and gut barrier integrity. Thus, this study provides insights into how diet-induced metabolic differences in MD bacteria determine their distinct physiological roles in the host immune response and the gut ecosystem."

This study reports the isolation and characterization of six bacteriophages (phages) isolated from human fecal material and environmental samples that infect this species. Isolated phages have a siphovirus morphology, with genomes ranging between 36.5 and 37.8 kbp. Genome analysis indicates that the phages have a temperate lifestyle, which was confirmed by their ability to form lysogens on their host bacterial species. In contrast to the finding that phages lyse their host in liquid medium, results from a mouse trial indicate these phages can co-exist with the host bacterium in the gut without causing a significant reduction of R. gnavus. The bacterial counts in the feces of phage-treated mice did not significantly differ in the presence of phage. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available gut virome sequence data indicates a high abundance of these phages among individuals suffering from IBD. This work provides the first insight into how phages interact with R. gnavus in the human gut microbiome."

Some gut bacteria utilize mucus as a nutrient source and can under certain conditions damage the protective barrier it forms, increasing disease susceptibility. We investigated how Ruminococcus torques—a known mucin-degrader that remains poorly studied despite its implication in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)— degrades mucin glycoproteins or their component O-linked glycans to understand its effects on the availability of mucin-derived nutrients for other bacteria. We found that R. torques utilizes both mucin glycoproteins and released oligosaccharides from gastric and colonic mucins, degrading these substrates with a panoply of mostly constitutively expressed, secreted enzymes. Investigation of mucin oligosaccharide degradation by R. torques revealed strong fucosidase, sialidase and β1,4-galactosidase activities. There was a lack of detectable sulfatase and weak β1,3-galactosidase degradation, resulting in accumulation of glycans containing these structures on mucin polypeptides. While the Gram-negative symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron grows poorly on mucin glycoproteins, we demonstrate a clear ability of R. torques to liberate products from mucins, making them accessible to B. thetaiotaomicron. This work underscores the diversity of mucin-degrading mechanisms in different bacterial species and the probability that some species are contingent on others for the ability to more fully access mucin-derived nutrients. The ability of R. torques to directly degrade a variety of mucin and mucin glycan structures and unlock released glycans for other species suggests that it is a keystone mucin degrader, which may contribute to its association with IBD. Importance An important facet of maintaining healthy symbiosis between host and intestinal microbes is the mucus layer, the first defense protecting the epithelium from lumenal bacteria. Some gut bacteria degrade different components of intestinal mucins, but detailed mechanisms used by different species are still emerging. It is imperative to understand these mechanisms as they likely dictate interspecies interactions and may illuminate particular species associated with bacterial mucus destruction and subsequent disease susceptibility. Ruminococcus torques is positively associated with IBD in multiple studies. We identified mucin glycan-degrading enzymes in R. torques and found that it shares mucin degradation products with another gut bacterium implicated in IBD, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the mucin degradation mechanisms of different gut bacteria and their consequences on interspecies interactions, which may identify keystone bacteria that disproportionately contribute to defects in mucus protection and could therefore be targets to prevent or treat IBD."

To access this source of nutrients, gut bacteria encode α-L-fucosidases (fucosidases) which catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal α-L-fucosidic linkages. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of fucosidases from the human gut symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus. Sequence similarity network identified strain-specific fucosidases in R. gnavus ATCC 29149 and E1 strains that were further validated enzymatically against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. Using a combination of glycan microarrays, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, crystallographic and saturation transfer difference NMR approaches, we identified a fucosidase with the capacity to recognize sialic acid-terminated fucosylated glycans (sialyl Lewis X/A epitopes) and hydrolyze α1-3/4 fucosyl linkages in these substrates without the need to remove sialic acid. Molecular dynamics simulation and docking showed that 3'-Sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) could be accommodated within the binding site of the enzyme. This specificity may contribute to the adaptation of R. gnavus strains to the infant and adult gut and has potential applications in diagnostic glycomic assays for diabetes and certain cancers."
