In this study, we present a characterization on the strains Clostridium celatum WC0700, Clostridium tertium WC0709, and Paraclostridium bifermentans WC0705. These three strains were previously isolated from enrichment cultures on mucin of fecal samples from healthy subjects and can use mucin as sole carbon and nitrogen source. Genome analysis and in vitro functional analysis of these strains elucidated their physiological and biochemical features. C. celatum WC0700 harbored the highest number of glycosyl hydrolases specific for mucin degradation, while P. bifermentans WC0705 had the least. These predicted differences were confirmed growing the strains on 5 mucin-decorating monosaccharides (L-fucose, N-Acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and N-acetylglucosamine) as only source of carbon. Fermenting mucin, they all produced formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, isovaleric, and lactic acids, and ethanol; acetic acid was the main primary metabolite. Further catabolic capabilities were investigated, as well as antibiotic susceptibility, biofilm formation, tolerance to oxygen and temperature. The potential pathogenicity of the strains was evaluated through in silico research of virulence factors. The merge between comparative and functional genomics and biochemical/physiological characterization provided a comprehensive view of these mucin degraders, reassuring on the safety of these species and leaving ample scope for deeper investigations on the relationship with the host and for assessing if some relevant health-promoting effect could be ascribed to these SCFA producing species.","The genomic and functional analysis of C. celatum, C. tertium, and P. bifermentans strains revealed their mucinolytic capabilities and potential safety as probiotics."

These bacteria play many beneficial roles and in some cases can modify disease states, making it important to understand which nutrients sustain specific lineages. ABSTRACT Symbiotic bacteria are responsible for the majority of complex carbohydrate digestion in the human colon. Since the identities and amounts of dietary polysaccharides directly impact the gut microbiota, determining which microorganisms consume specific nutrients is central for defining the relationship between diet and gut microbial ecology. Using a custom phenotyping array, we determined carbohydrate utilization profiles for 354 members of the Bacteroidetes, a dominant saccharolytic phylum. There was wide variation in the numbers and types of substrates degraded by individual bacteria, but phenotype-based clustering grouped members of the same species indicating that each species performs characteristic roles. The ability to utilize dietary polysaccharides and endogenous mucin glycans was negatively correlated, suggesting exclusion between these niches. By analyzing related Bacteroides ovatus/Bacteroides xylanisolvens strains that vary in their ability to utilize mucin glycans, we addressed whether gene clusters that confer this complex, multilocus trait are being gained or lost in individual strains. Pangenome reconstruction of these strains revealed a remarkably mosaic architecture in which genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism are highly variable and bioinformatics data provide evidence of interspecies gene transfer that might explain this genomic heterogeneity. Global transcriptomic analyses suggest that the ability to utilize mucin has been lost in some lineages of B. ovatus and B. xylanisolvens, which harbor residual gene clusters that are involved in mucin utilization by strains that still actively express this phenotype. Our data provide insight into the breadth and complexity of carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome and the underlying genomic events that shape these behaviors. IMPORTANCE Nonharmful bacteria are the primary microbial symbionts that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria play many beneficial roles and in some cases can modify disease states, making it important to understand which nutrients sustain specific lineages. This knowledge will in turn lead to strategies to intentionally manipulate the gut microbial ecosystem. We designed a scalable, high-throughput platform for measuring the ability of gut bacteria to utilize polysaccharides, of which many are derived from dietary fiber sources that can be manipulated easily. Our results provide paths to expand phenotypic surveys of more diverse gut bacteria to understand their functions and also to leverage dietary fibers to alter the physiology of the gut microbial community.","A scalable, high-throughput platform for measuring the ability of gut bacteria to utilize polysaccharides, of which many are derived from dietary fiber sources that can be manipulated easily is designed."

Derrien","","","Keywords . Mucin, A. muciniphila , mucin degradation, molecular techniques, host response Mucins are the major organic components of the defence barrier, known as mucus, covering epithelial cells in many organs, including the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microbes that can associate with mucins benefit from this interaction since they can access nutrients. Mucin-degrading bacteria are therefore an important community that have not been extensively studied as the substrate itself, mucin, is a complex and high molecular weight glycoprotein. The work presented here is focused on the identification and isolation of mucin-degrading bacteria from the GI tract, their degradation of mucin and their interaction with the host. Mucin-degrading bacteria were analysed by combining molecular- and cultivation-based approaches. The faecal mucin-degrading bacterial community was found to be highly diverse and host-specific. A novel isolate, representing a novel genus, was cultured from the highest dilution of the enrichment of a single individual. This intestinal isolate, Akkermansia muciniphila, was found to grow to a limited extent on a very limited amount of substrates but grew efficiently on mucin. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences indicated that A. muciniphila belonged to the phylum Verrucomicrobia, which was not known to contain intestinal members. Moreover, 16S rRNA genes from A. muciniphila have been retrieved in several clone libraries derived from either faecal or biopsy samples from human and mice. In addition, A. muciniphila was found to be rather abundant in the GI tract. Based on fluorescent in situ hybridisation and quantitative PCR, A. muciniphila was found to represent an average of 10 9 cells / g faecal sample. A negative correlation between the concentration of faecal mucin and the number of A. muciniphila was observed, suggesting it to be involved in mucin degradation in vivo . Several specific enzymes, mostly glycosidases were found to be secreted during its growth on mucin that was degraded for a major part (85%). Hence, the specific impact of A. muciniphila on the host was investigated in germ-free mice and compared to that of the non mucin-degrading bacterium L. plantarum . Transcriptomic microarray analysis showed that both A. muciniphila and L. plantarum modulated a similar number of genes but that host response was found to be highly specific for each bacterium, depending on the anatomical location. Amongst the major responses, we could detect for A. muciniphila a regulation of the immune response, cell proliferation, cell adhesion and apoptosis, and for L. plantarum a regulation of the lipid metabolism. Overall, this work has brought new insights into the mucin-degrading community of bacteria, and in particular the role of A. muciniphila, an abundant human mucin-degrading bacterium.","This work has brought new insights into the mucin-degrading community of bacteria, and in particular the role of A. muciniphila, an abundant human mucIn- Degrading bacterium, found to be rather abundant in the GI tract."

Here, we report the isolation of six novel strains from healthy human donors and their genomic, proteomic and physiological characterization in comparison to the type-strains A. muciniphila MucT and A. glycaniphila PytT. Complete genome sequencing revealed that, despite their large genomic similarity (>97.6%), the novel isolates clustered into two distinct subspecies of A. muciniphila: Amuc1, which includes the type-strain MucT, and AmucU, a cluster of unassigned strains that have not yet been well characterized. CRISPR analysis showed all strains to be unique and confirmed that single healthy subjects can carry more than one A. muciniphila strain. Mucin degradation pathways were strongly conserved amongst all isolates, illustrating the exemplary niche adaptation of A. muciniphila to the mucin interface. This was confirmed by analysis of the predicted glycoside hydrolase profiles and supported by comparing the proteomes of A. muciniphila strain H2, belonging to the AmucU cluster, to MucT and A. glycaniphila PytT (including 610 and 727 proteins, respectively). While some intrinsic resistance was observed among the A. muciniphila straind, none of these seem to pose strain-specific risks in terms of their antibiotic resistance patterns nor a significant risk for the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants, opening the way to apply the type-strain MucT or these new A. muciniphila strains as next generation beneficial microbes.","Six novel strains from healthy human donors are isolated and their genomic, proteomic and physiological characterization in comparison to the type-strains A. muciniphila MucT and A. glycaniphila PytT reveal strong conserved mucin degradation pathways, illustrating the exemplary niche adaptation of A."

Most of O-glycans have N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as a common core. Several glycoproteins, such as mucins (MUCs), immunoglobulins, and caseins are examples of O-glycosylated structures. These glycans are further elongated with other monosaccharides and sulfate groups. Some of them could be found in dairy foods, while others are produced endogenously, in both cases interacting with the gut microbiota. Interestingly, certain gut microbes can access, release, and consume O-linked glycans as a carbon source. Among these, Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are prominent O-linked glycan utilizers. Their consumption strategies include specialized α-fucosidases and α-sialidases, in addition to endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases that release galacto-N-biose (GNB) from peptides backbones. O-linked glycan utilization by certain gut microbes represents an important niche that allows them to predominate and modulate host responses such as inflammation. Here, we focus on the distinct molecular mechanisms of consumption of O-linked GalNAc glycans by prominent gut microbes, especially from mucin and casein glycomacropeptide (GMP), highlighting the potential of these structures as emerging prebiotics.","This work focuses on the distinct molecular mechanisms of consumption of O-linked GalNAc glycans by prominent gut microbes, especially from mucin and casein glycomacropeptide (GMP), highlighting the potential of these structures as emerging prebiotics."

Two hundred and thirty mucin-grown colonies from the caecal contents of 7 rabbits were examined microscopically after the Gram staining. Gram-negative irregular rods were the most numerous mucinolytic isolates (34.1%), followed by gram-negative cocci and short rods (22.5%), gram-positive rods (17.3%), gram-positive cocci (16.6%) and gram-positive sporeforming rods (9.5%). An attempt was done to identify 31 typical isolates on basis of their morphology, biochemical characteristics and production of metabolites. In addition, bacterial cells were hybridized with fluorescently labelled probes for Bacteroides/Prevotella and Clostridium genus. Four isolates were identified at the species level as Mitsuokella multiacidus, three isolates as Bacteroides capillosus and one isolate as Actinomyces izraeli. All isolates except the last one belong to the Bacteroidaceae family. One strain could be assigned to the Bacteroides/Prevotella genus on basis of the hybridization test. Other mucinolytic isolates were not identified as their characteristics did not correspond to any previously described bacterial species. No Clostridium sp. strain was detected. In two M. multiacidus strains high activities of extracellular mucin lyases were found. The pH-optimum of lyases was 6.2. Calcium cations were necessary for their optimal function. This work extends general knowledge about fermentation of carbohydrate and nitrogen substrates in rabbit caecum. Rabbit, caecum, mucin, bacteria Mucin is a glycoprotein present in the mucosal layer lining mammalian gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tract. The carbohydrate moiety can be either an acidic mucopolysaccharide containing uronic acids and hexosamines or an oligosaccharide containing L-fucose and sialic acid (S alyers and Leedle 1983). Mucin composition is tissue specific and differs in different animal species. Mucin is a part of the defense mechanism as it prevents bacteria, viruses and dietary lectins from attaching to the intestinal or other epithelium. Another mucin function is the protection of the mucosal epithelium against acidic and proteolytic damage in the stomach and intestine. In the digestive tract, mucin insures a smooth passage of the foodpulp. Holmes et al. (1974) observed in pigs that large amounts of mucin were not digested in the small intestine, but fermented in the hindgut.

Ndeh","","","Trillions of microorganisms inhabit mucosal surfaces of the human body. Despite increasing evidence of their impact on human health, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying hostmicrobial interactions (HMI) are poorly understood. To contribute to our understanding of HMI at mucosal surfaces, we investigated the novel family of M60-like/PF13402 domain-containing proteins and their putative functional partners. M60-like domains are shared by proteins from several mucosal microbes including two important human mucosal microbes; the bacterial mutualist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the protist pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis, suggesting these proteins are important for interaction with the mucosal layer. We initially tested our hypothesis that these are glycoprotein-targeted metal dependent proteases in both these organisms. The three M60-like domains of B. thetaiotaomicron proteins (BT4244, BT3015 and BT4272) exhibited mucin protease activity. This proteolytic activity was shown to be inhibited in a mutant version of the protein (BT4244-FL-E575D) as well as in the presence of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), implying BT4244 and its relatives are metal dependent proteases. All M60-like proteins from B. thetaiotaomicron contained a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) from family 32 and these were shown to be capable of binding galacto-configured sugars that are common to mucin glycans, while in contrast the putative carbohydrate binding PA14 domain of the T. vaginalis TVAG339720 M60-like protein interacted with heparin and its sulphated derivatives. Mucins are glycoproteins and prominent components of the mucus secreted at mucosal surfaces while heparin is a close relative of heparan sulphate which typically exists as part of proteoglycans in the glycocalyx of mucosal epithelia. Although the actual target of the M60-like domain of TVAG339720 and its relatives in T. vaginalis are not currently known, the interaction of the TVAG339720 PA14 domain with heparin suggests that these may be proteases targeting proteoglycans and play a role in adhesion of the pathogen to the epithelial layer, a key initial step in pathogenesis. M60-like domain-containing proteins of B. thetaiotaomicron are also components of Sus-like systems. Sus-like systems are Bacteroidetes specific machinery that comprise a suite of cellenvelope located carbohydrate-active enzymes and sugar binding proteins that target complex glycans, with each Sus-like system tuned to the degradation of a specific glycan. The Sus-like system containing the BT4244 enzyme (BT4240-50), encoded by the polysaccharide locus (PUL) PULBT_4240-50 was characterised in this study. The results demonstrated that BT4244 is a surface protein and that its proteolytic activity is part of a concerted action of BT4240-50 components to utilise complex mucin glycoproteins containing the T (Galβ1-3GalNAc) and F (GalNAcα1-3GalNAc) antigens. Gene deletion studies revealed that PULBT_4240-50 provides a competitive advantage to the organism when grown on mucins, probably through its possession of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) kinase BT4240, which was shown to be crucial for GalNAc utilisation. Finally, although variably conserved in closely related Bacteroides, the high frequency of PULBT_4240-50 components in this group of organisms suggests it may be an important evolutionary adaptation for survival at mucosal surfaces. Our findings not only set the stage for future functional studies on the novel M60-like/PF13402 family of proteins and their functional partners, but also further our understanding of host-microbial interactions at mucosal surfaces.","The results demonstrated that BT4244 is a surface protein and that its proteolytic activity is part of a concerted action of BT4240-50 components to utilise complex mucin glycoproteins containing the T (Galβ1-3 GalNAc) and F (GalNAcα 1-3GalNAC) antigens."

Of 2,318 protein-coding genes in the genome, we identified 841 (40%) that were expressed at the protein level. Overall, proteins involved in energy production and carbohydrate metabolism indicate that A. muciniphila relies mainly on the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, and produces short-chain fatty acids through anaerobic fermentation in a nutrient-specific manner.

Commensals that compete with pathogens for such nutrients are therefore ecological gatekeepers in healthy guts, and are attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there is a poor understanding of which commensals use mucin-derived sugars in situ as well as their potential to impede pathogen colonization. Here, we identify mouse gut commensals that utilize mucus-derived monosaccharides within complex communities using single-cell stable isotope probing, Raman-activated cell sorting and mini-metagenomics.

Mucins are complex glycoproteins that serve as a nutrient source for resident microflora and can be exploited by pathogens. We aimed to understand how the intestinal pathogen, Clostridioides diffiicile, independently uses or manipulates mucus to its benefit, without contributions from members of the microbiota. Using a 2-D primary human intestinal epithelial cell model to generate physiologic mucus, we assessed C. difficile-mucus interactions through growth assays, RNA-Seq, biophysical characterization of mucus, and contextualized metabolic modeling. We found that host-derived mucus promotes C. difficile growth both in vitro and in an infection model. RNA-Seq revealed significant upregulation of genes related to central metabolism in response to mucus, including genes involved in sugar uptake, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, and the glycine cleavage system. In addition, we identified differential expression of genes related to sensing and transcriptional control. Analysis of mutants with deletions in highly upregulated genes reflected the complexity of C. difficile-mucus interactions, with potential interplay between sensing and growth. Mucus also stimulated biofilm formation in vitro, which may in turn alter viscoelastic properties of mucus. Context-specific metabolic modeling confirmed differential metabolism and predicted importance of enzymes related to serine and glycine catabolism with mucus. Subsequent growth experiments supported these findings, indicating mucus is an important source of serine. Our results better define responses of C. difficile to human gastrointestinal mucus and highlight a flexibility in metabolism that may influence pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Clostridioides difficile results in upwards of 250,000 infections and 12,000 deaths annually in the United States. Community-acquired infections continue to rise and recurrent disease is common, emphasizing a vital need to understand C. difficile pathogenesis. C. difficile undoubtedly interacts with colonic mucus, but the extent to which the pathogen can independently respond to and take advantage of this niche has not been explored extensively. Moreover, the metabolic complexity of C. difficile remains poorly understood, but likely impacts its capacity to grow and persist in the host. Here, we demonstrate that C. difficile uses native colonic mucus for growth, indicating C. difficile possesses mechanisms to exploit the mucosal niche. Furthermore, mucus induces metabolic shifts and biofilm formation in C. difficile, which has potential ramifications for intestinal colonization. Overall, our work is crucial to better understand dynamics of C. difficile-mucus interactions in the context of the human gut.","It is demonstrated that C. difficile uses native colonic mucus for growth, indicating C. difficile possesses mechanisms to exploit the mucosal niche and induces metabolic shifts and biofilm formation in C. difficile, which has potential ramifications for intestinal colonization."

The viscous layer is organized in bilayers, i.e., an outer layer that is loosely arranged, variable in thickness, home to the commensal microbiota that grows in the complex environment, and an innermost layer that is stratified, non-aspirated, firmly adherent to the epithelial cells and devoid of any microorganisms. The O-glycosylation moiety represents the site of adhesion for pathogens and due to the increase of motility, mucolytic activity, and upregulation of virulence factors, some microorganisms can circumvent the component of the mucus layer and cause disruption in organ homeostasis. A dysbiotic microbiome, defective mucus barrier, and altered immune response often result in various diseases. In this review, paramount emphasis is given to the role played by the bacterial species directly or indirectly involved in mucin degradation, alteration in mucus secretion or its composition or mucin gene expression, which instigates many diseases in the digestive, respiratory, and other organ systems.

We investigated how Ruminococcus torques—a known mucin-degrader that remains poorly studied despite its implication in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)— degrades mucin glycoproteins or their component O-linked glycans to understand its effects on the availability of mucin-derived nutrients for other bacteria. We found that R. torques utilizes both mucin glycoproteins and released oligosaccharides from gastric and colonic mucins, degrading these substrates with a panoply of mostly constitutively expressed, secreted enzymes. Investigation of mucin oligosaccharide degradation by R. torques revealed strong fucosidase, sialidase and β1,4-galactosidase activities.

Even with some Bacteroides species being categorized as pathogens, Bacteroides is one of the most dominant gut bacteria. Here we indicate the physiological determinants of the species of Bacteroides for being dominant in human gut microbiota. Each of the host extracellular mucosubstances including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and mucin has grown human gut microbiota. In spite of the differences among initial microbiota profiles, Bacteroides species dominated the community when GAG (e.g., chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronan) was used as a sole carbon source. In fact, GAGs and the Bacteroides genes which are vital for the degradation of GAGs were commonly detected in human feces. Mucin has encouraged the growth of Bacteroides and several other genera. A comprehensive analysis on the degradation and assimilation of mucosubstances by the genus Bacteroides using around 30 species has shown that most species degrade and assimilate GAGs and mucin, showing that Bacteroides species can survive even in the undernutrition condition including the fasting state. In the assimilation of GAG or mucin, Bacteroides species significantly secreted essential amino acids, γ-amino butyrate (GABA), and/or short-chain fatty acids which are needed for human health. This is the first report as regards mutually beneficial interaction between human and Bacteroides species via bacterial assimilation of host mucosubstances and secretion of metabolites for host health promotion.

Here, we describe the specificities of ten A. muciniphila glycoside hydrolases, which collectively remove all known sialyl and fucosyl mucin caps including those with double sulphated epitopes. Structural analyses revealed an unprecedented fucosidase modular arrangement and explained the exclusive sialyl T-antigen specificity of a sialidase of a previously unknown family and catalytic apparatus. Key cell attached sialidases and fucosidases conferred mucin-binding and their inhibition abolished growth of A. muciniphila on mucin. Remarkably, the sialic acid fucose did not contribute to A. muciniphila growth, but instead promoted butyrate production by co-cultured Clostridia.

Mucins are complex glycoproteins that serve as a nutrient source for resident microflora and can be exploited by pathogens. We aimed to understand how the intestinal pathogen, Clostridioides difficile , independently uses or manipulates mucus to its benefit, without contributions from members of the microbiota. Using a 2-D primary human intestinal epithelial cell model to generate physiologic mucus, we assessed C. difficile- mucus interactions through growth assays, RNA-Seq, biophysical characterization of mucus, and contextualized metabolic modeling. We found that host-derived mucus promotes C. difficile growth both in vitro and in an infection model. RNA-Seq revealed significant upregulation of genes related to central metabolism in response to mucus, including genes involved in sugar uptake, the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, and the glycine cleavage system. In addition, we identified differential expression of genes related to sensing and transcriptional control. Analysis of mutants with deletions in highly upregulated genes reflected the complexity of C. difficile -mucus interactions, with potential interplay between sensing and growth. Mucus also stimulated biofilm formation in vitro , which may in turn alter the viscoelastic properties of mucus. Context-specific metabolic modeling confirmed differential metabolism and the predicted importance of enzymes related to serine and glycine catabolism with mucus. Subsequent growth experiments supported these findings, indicating mucus is an important source of serine. Our results better define responses of C. difficile to human gastrointestinal mucus and highlight flexibility in metabolism that may influence pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Clostridioides difficile results in upward of 250,000 infections and 12,000 deaths annually in the United States. Community-acquired infections continue to rise, and recurrent disease is common, emphasizing a vital need to understand C. difficile pathogenesis. C. difficile undoubtedly interacts with colonic mucus, but the extent to which the pathogen can independently respond to and take advantage of this niche has not been explored extensively. Moreover, the metabolic complexity of C. difficile remains poorly understood but likely impacts its capacity to grow and persist in the host. Here, we demonstrate that C. difficile uses native colonic mucus for growth, indicating C. difficile possesses mechanisms to exploit the mucosal niche. Furthermore, mucus induces metabolic shifts and biofilm formation in C. difficile , which has potential ramifications for intestinal colonization.

Microbes that can associate with mucins benefit from this interaction since they can get available nutrients, experience physico-chemical protection and adhere, resulting in increased residence time. Mucin-degrading microorganisms, which often are found in consortia, have not been extensively characterized as mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins that are hard to study because of their size, complexity and heterogeneity. The purpose of this review is to discuss how advances in mucus and mucin research, and insight in the microbial ecology promoted our understanding of mucin degradation. Recent insight is presented in mucin structure and organization, the microorganisms known to use mucin as growth substrate, with a specific attention on Akkermansia muciniphila, and the molecular basis of microbial mucin degradation owing to availability of genome sequences.","This review discusses how advances in mucus and mucin research, and insight in the microbial ecology promoted the understanding of mucin degradation, and recent insight is presented in mucin structure and organization."

Twenty-five strains grew well on mucin: 20 from infants, two from adults, and three from goatlings. Poor or no growth on mucin was observed in 156 bifidobacterial strains of animal origin. The difference between human and animal isolates in ability to grow on mucin was significant at p < 0.001. Nine human strains with the best growth on mucin were identified as Bifidobacterium bifidum. These strains produced extracellular, membrane-bound, and intracellular mucinases with activities of 0.11, 0.53, and 0.09 μmol/min of reducing sugars per milligram of protein, respectively. Membrane-bound mucinases were active between pH 5 and 10. The optimum pH of extracellular mucinases was 6–7. Fermentation patterns in cultures grown on mucin and glucose differed. On mucin, the acetate-to-lactate ratio was higher than in cultures grown on glucose (p = 0.012). We showed that the bifidobacteria belong to the mucin-fermenting bacteria in humans, but their significance in mucin degradation in animals seems to be limited.","It is shown that the bifidobacteria belong to the mucin-fermenting bacteria in humans, but their significance in mucin degradation in animals seems to be limited."

Yet, many of its bacterial constituents are functionally still largely unexplored. A crucial prerequisite for bacterial survival and proliferation is the creation and/or exploitation of an own niche. For many bacterial species that are linked to human disease, the inner mucus layer was found to be an important niche. Allobaculum mucolyticum is a newly identified, IBD-associated species that is thought be closely associated with the host epithelium. To explore how this bacterium is able to effectively colonize this niche, we screened its genome for factors that may contribute to mucosal colonization. Up to 60 genes encoding putative Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) were identified in the genome of A. mucolyticum. Mass spectrometry revealed 49 CAZymes of which 26 were significantly enriched in its secretome. Functional assays demonstrated the presence of CAZyme activity in A. mucolyticum conditioned medium, degradation of human mucin O-glycans, and utilization of liberated non-terminal monosaccharides for bacterial growth. The results support a model in which sialidases and fucosidases remove terminal O-glycan sugars enabling subsequent degradation and utilization of carbohydrates for A. mucolyticum growth. A. mucolyticum CAZyme secretion may thus facilitate bacterial colonization and degradation of the mucus layer and may pose an interesting target for future therapeutic intervention.","In this article, Allobaculum mucolyticum is identified as a newly identified, IBD-associated species that is thought be closely associated with the host epithelium."

We fractionated and characterized this enzyme demonstrating hydrolysis of the B epitope on erythrocyte membranes and seroconversion to H epitope (blood type O). Since the enzyme yield was low, cell suspension studies could not be performed. Instead, hydrolysis of the B membrane epitope was studied with an ELISA. A highly purified enzyme product was analyzed for characteristics such as pH, ionic strength, and temperature optimum. Activity in red cell preservative solutions and in the presence of type B plasma was also demonstrated.

Since the identities and amounts of dietary polysaccharides directly impact the gut microbiota, determining which microorganisms consume specific nutrients is central to defining the relationship between diet and gut microbial ecology. Using a custom phenotyping array, we determined carbohydrate utilization profiles for 354 members of the Bacteroidetes, a dominant saccharolytic phylum. There was wide variation in the numbers and types of substrates degraded by individual bacteria, but phenotype-based clustering grouped members of the same species indicating that each species performs characteristic roles. The ability to utilize dietary polysaccharides and endogenous mucin glycans was negatively correlated, suggesting exclusion between these niches. By analyzing related Bacteroides ovatus/xylanisolvens strains that vary in their ability to utilize mucin glycans, we addressed whether gene clusters that confer this complex, multi-locus trait are being gained or lost in individual strains. Pangenome reconstruction of these strains revealed a remarkably mosaic architecture in which genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism are highly variable and bioinformatics data provide evidence of interspecies gene transfer that might explain this genomic heterogeneity. Global transcriptomic analyses suggest that the ability to utilize mucin has been lost in some lineages of B. ovatus and B. xylanisolvens, which still harbor residual gene clusters that are involved in mucin utilization by strains that still actively express this phenotype. Our data provide insight into the breadth and complexity of carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome and the underlying genomic events that shape these behaviors.","This article used a custom phenotyping array to determine carbohydrate utilization profiles for 354 members of the Bacteroidetes, a dominant saccharolytic phylum, and found that the ability to utilize dietary polysaccharides and endogenous mucin glycans was negatively correlated."

It has been positioned as a health biomarker and is currently being explored as a biotherapeutic agent and next-generation probiotic. Preliminary and ongoing research is mostly based on in vivo mouse models and human intervention trials. While these allow the assessment of physiologically relevant endpoints, the analysis of fecal samples presents limitations with respect to the in-depth mechanistic characterization of Akkermansia′s effects at the level of the microbiome. We aimed to evaluate the effect of A. muciniphila treatment on the endogenous community from four different donors in a validated, controlled in vitro model of the gut microbial ecosystem (SHIME). Taking into account the nutritional specificity of A. muciniphila and the prebiotic-like action of mucins in the colon environment, the interplay between mucin, A. muciniphila, and the endogenous community was investigated. The effects on the microbial community composition and functionality of A. muciniphila supplementation without mucin were limited, whereas mucin addition successfully induced compositional and metabolic changes in the gut microbiota. Indeed, mucin addition resulted in significantly higher acetate, propionate, and butyrate production for all four donors and the increase of several bacteria, including A. muciniphila, Ruminococcus, Clostridium cluster XIVa, and Lachnospiraceae. This study revealed that the supplementation of A. muciniphila together with mucin limited the observed prebiotic-like effect of mucin in inducing compositional changes. IMPORTANCE Research into the identification of biomarkers for gut health and ways to modulate the microbiota composition and activity to improve health has put Akkermansia muciniphila in the spotlight. As a mucin degrader, A. muciniphila colonizes the interesting but not fully described host-glycan degradation niche. Much research concerning A. muciniphila has been done, but little is known about its behavior in the complex microbial ecosystem in the colon, the potential of mucins to influence A. muciniphila behavior, and the impact of its probiotic administration on the microbial ecosystem. This study aimed at investigating the impact of A. muciniphila administration on the endogenous community while also taking into account its nutritional specificity. As such, the effect of A. muciniphila administration was investigated with and without addition of mucin. This allowed us to elucidate the importance of the presence of mucin to modulate the efficiency of probiotic supplementation with A. muciniphila.","It is revealed that the supplementation of A. muciniphila together with mucin limited the observed prebiotic-like effect of mucin in inducing compositional changes in the gut microbiota."
