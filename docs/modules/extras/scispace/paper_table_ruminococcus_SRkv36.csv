However, MD bacterial physiology and metabolism remain elusive. Here, we assessed functional modules of mucin catabolism, through a comprehensive bioinformatics-aided functional annotation, to identify 54 A. muciniphila genes and 296 R. gnavus genes. The reconstructed core metabolic pathways coincided with the growth kinetics and fermentation profiles of A. muciniphila and R. gnavus grown in the presence of mucin and its constituents. Genome-wide multi-omics analyses validated the nutrient-dependent fermentation profiles of the MD bacteria and identified their distinct mucolytic enzymes. The distinct metabolic features of the two MD bacteria induced differences in the metabolite receptor levels and inflammatory signals of the host immune cells. In addition, in vivo experiments and community-scale metabolic modeling demonstrated that different dietary intakes influenced the abundance of MD bacteria, their metabolic fluxes, and gut barrier integrity. Thus, this study provides insights into how diet-induced metabolic differences in MD bacteria determine their distinct physiological roles in the host immune response and the gut ecosystem.","In this paper , a comprehensive bioinformatics-aided functional annotation was performed to identify 54 Akkermansia muciniphila and 296 Ruminococcus gnavus genes."

While R. gnavus is not considered a pathogen, overabundance of this species is correlated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its sialic acid metabolism may play a role in the dysbiotic state. Interestingly, liberation of mucin-bound sialic acid by R. gnavus yields the distinct product of 2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), in contrast to other known mucin-degrading bacteria, which generate Neu5Ac. This prompted us to look for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism proteins in the genomes of 77 R. gnavus clinical isolates. We found that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism is sporadically distributed in this species with respect to phylogeny and strain origin. We measured sialic acid-dependent growth of 12 sequenced isolates, finding that the presence of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism proteins was predictive of growth on this substrate. Our analysis also uncovered ""partial"" 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism pathways in two R. gnavus strains, leading to the discovery that these strains grow with Neu5Ac as a sole carbon source, a metabolic capability previously unreported in this species.

Ruminococcus gnavus is a common resident of the human gut, but often blooms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It remains unclear whether R. gnavus plays any direct role in disease occurrence. This study investigates R. gnavus utilization of sialic acid, a crucial component of host mucins, the main constituents of the mucus that lines and protects the gut. We profile variations in sialic acid metabolic pathways and growth among 77 R. gnavus strains, isolated from healthy people and individuals with IBD, discovering further diversity in sialic acid utilization than was previously appreciated. This study emphasizes that the intricate interaction between bacteria and their environment must be examined at the strain level to understand the roles of particular species in health and disease.

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut microbiota in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease.","A unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease is revealed."

Notably, we uncovered a novel pathway by which R. gnavus ATCC 29149 utilises sialic acid from sialylated substrates. Our results also demonstrated the ability of R. gnavus ATCC 29149 to produce propanol and propionate as the end products of metabolism when grown on mucin and fucosylated glycans.

Transcriptomics analyses of both ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 strains confirmed that the strategy utilized by R. gnavus for mucin-degradation is focused on the utilization of terminal mucin glycans.

Using anaerobic individual and co-cultures of R. bromii and R. gnavus grown on mucin or starch as sole carbon source, we showed that starch degradation by R. bromii supported the growth of R. gnavus whereas R. bromii did not benefit from mucin degradation by R. gnavus. Further we analyzed the growth (quantitative PCR), metabolite production (1H NMR analysis), and bacterial transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) of R. bromii cultured with RS or soluble starch (SS) in the presence or absence of R. gnavus. In co-culture fermentations on starch, 1H NMR analysis showed that R. gnavus benefits from transient glucose and malto-oligosaccharides released by R. bromii upon starch degradation, producing acetate, formate, and lactate as main fermentation end-products. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) on starch (SS and RS) showed that the presence of R. bromii induced changes in R. gnavus transcriptional response of genes encoding several maltose transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism such as maltose phosphorylase, in line with the ability of R. gnavus to utilize R. bromii starch degradation products. In the RS co-culture, R. bromii showed a significant increase in the induction of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes and a decrease of vitamin B12 (VitB12)-dependent methionine biosynthesis as compared to the mono-culture, suggesting that Trp and VitB12 availability become limited in the presence of R. gnavus. Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R. gnavus population inhabiting the mucus niche may be modulated by the supply of non-digestible carbohydrates reaching the colon such as RS.","Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R.

We established a link between Rg and ileal CD AIEC strain LF82 by showing that dual colonization of ex-germ-free (GF) IL10-/- mice potentiated colitis and cecal H2S production. Rg precultured mucus increased LF82 growth and H2S production, H2S supported in vitro Rg survival in minimal medium, and H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo (DDW 2023). Rg’s capsule contains glucose and has an enzyme that cleaves off sialic acid (Neu5Ac), one of the terminal carbohydrates of mucus. Because inflamed colons become microaerophilic to some extent, we focused on Rg-derived glucose and mucus-derived Neu5Ac to explore expression of LF82 molecular pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. HYPOTHESIS AIEC LF82 genes regulating growth, H2S production and virulence are differentially expressed with glucose or Neu5Ac substrates in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. METHODS LF82 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with Rg-/mucus-derived carbohydrates or gut-relevant sulfur substrates for 16 hours in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. LF82 RNA cultured with glucose or Neu5Ac medium in each condition was isolated for RNA sequencing. We compared aerobic vs. anaerobic results for each medium with |Log2FC| &amp;gt; 3.0 considered significant change. RESULTS Rg associated mucus carbohydrates and gut-relevant sulfur substrates variably enhanced LF82 growth. LF82 grew better in Neu5Ac than glucose in aerobic and vice versa in anaerobic conditions (Fig.1). Neu5Ac metabolism pathways involving nanE (N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase) and dnaA (chromosomal replication initiator), directly involved in cell replication, were overexpressed in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions in Neu5Ac medium. Additionally, expression of other Neu5Ac metabolic pathway genes, nanT (sialic transporter) and nanA (N-acetylneuraminate lyase) were slightly increased. Porin OmpC, a non-specific glucose transporter, and dnaA were more highly expressed in anaerobic than aerobic conditions in glucose medium (Table 1A). Moreover, LF82 genes involved in H2S production, biofilm formation and antimicrobial drug resistance were overexpressed in glucose vs. Neu5Ac with aerobic culture (Table 1B). CONCLUSIONS AIEC LF82 differentially uses R. gnavus released mucus components for growth in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions, and sialic acid and glucose activate distinct molecular pathways in the two conditions. Confirmatory functional experiments are underway. Glucose influences on LF82 H2S production and biofilm formation would provide strong evidence of cross-feeding between LF82 and R. gnavus, leading to potential diagnostic/treatment clues for further investigation.

Interactions between other CD-derived AIEC/non-AIEC and R. gnavus are unknown.
 
 
 
 Different AIEC and non-AIEC may grow and produce H2S differently using mucus digested by R. gnavus, which releases mucus-derived monosaccharides and sulfur substrates.
 
 
 
 We studied CD-derived clinical isolates of AIEC 541-15 (phylotype A), 541-1 (B1), LF82 and NRG857c (B2) and non-AIEC T75 (A) and lab strain K12 (A). M9 minimal media was supplemented with porcine gastric mucin (PGM), ileal (MIM) and colonic (MCoM) mucus isolated from germ-free mice. We measured growth kinetics and H2S production by these AIEC and non-AIEC following culture with sterile supernatants of each mucin/mucus media precultured with or without R. gnavus, monosaccharides obtained by R. gnavus digestion of mucus, and several sulfur substrates in the gut added to M9 minimal media.
 
 
 
 AIEC, especially LF82 (B2), grew better with ileal mucus aerobically and, to a lesser extent, anaerobically than non-AIEC strains, with even greater AIEC growth with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus (Fig.1). AIEC produced more H2S with R. gnavus-precultured mucus than with mucus alone. R. gnavus digestion of PGM released mucus monosaccharides (Fig.2A). AIEC strains grew differently with each monosaccharide constituent of R. gnavus pre-digested PGM. AIEC grew better than non-AIEC with each monosaccharide in aerobic conditions, but AIEC (B2) grew better than others in all monosaccharides in anaerobic conditions (Fig.2B). Amongst mucus-relevant sulfur substrates, L-cysteine was the only substrate to enhance E. coli H2S production by all AIEC and non-AIEC strains. All mucus-relevant sulfur substrates supported R. gnavus survival for 24 hrs, while H2S sustained R. gnavus for 48 hrs in minimum media.
 
 
 
 AIEC grew better and produced more H2S with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus suggesting that co-existence of AIEC with R. gnavus mutually support each other and may explain why they are often observed together in active CD patients. In addition, enhanced AIEC growth with ileal vs. colonic mucus may explain why AIEC are frequently isolated from ileal CD patients. AIEC phylotype growth differences with mucus substrates may explain their persistence in the ileal mucosa.

We previously showed that the ability of R. gnavus to forage on mucins is strain-dependent and associated with sialic acid metabolism. Here, we showed that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free (GF) mice. Changes in metabolites associated with brain function such as tryptamine, indolacetate, and trimethylamine N-oxide were also detected in the cecal content of Rg-mice when compared to GF mice. Next, we investigated the effect of R. gnavus monocolonization on hippocampus cell proliferation and behavior. We observed a significant decrease of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Rg-mice as compared to GF mice and recruitment of phagocytic microglia in the vicinity. Behavioral assessments suggested an improvement of the spatial working memory in Rg-mice but no change in other cognitive functions. These results were also supported by a significant upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and neuroplasticity. Collectively, these data provide first insights into how R. gnavus metabolites may influence brain regulation and function through modulation of granule cell development and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus. This work has implications for further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the role of R. gnavus in neurological disorders.","It is shown that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free mice."

Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from R. gnavus ATCC 29149, RgGH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that RgGH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed RgGH98 affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of RgGH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of RgGH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of RgGH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that RgGH98 is part of an operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when R. gnavus ATCC 29149 is grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed RgGH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that RgGH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with RgGH98 confered R. gnavus E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data further support that the GH repertoire of R. gnavus strains enable them to colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection.","Ruminococcus gnavus, a human gut symbiont, exhibits specificity to blood group A antigen during mucin glycan foraging, enabling niche colonization in the gastrointestinal tract through a dedicated hydrogen network of residues and operon overexpression."

Certain residents of this niche can degrade the large and complex mucin glycoproteins that constitute this layer and utilise the degradation products for their metabolism. In turn, this microbial mucin degradation drives specific microbiological ecological interactions in the human gut mucus layer. However, the exact nature of these interactions remains unknown. In this study, we designed and studied an in vitro mucin-degrading synthetic community that included mucin O-glycan degraders and cross-feeding microorganisms by monitoring community composition and dynamics through a combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, mucin glycan degradation with PGC-LC-MS/MS, production of mucin-degrading enzymes and other proteins through metaproteomics, and metabolite production with HPLC. We demonstrated that specialist and generalist mucin O-glycan degraders stably co-exist and found evidence for cross-feeding relationships. Cross-feeding on the products of mucin degradation by other gut microbes resulted in butyrate production, hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Metaproteomics analysis revealed that mucin glycan degraders Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and Ruminococcus torques together contributed 92% of the total mucin O-glycan degrading enzyme pool of this community. Furthermore, comparative proteomics showed that in response to cultivation in a community compared to monoculture, mucin glycan degraders increased carbohydrate-active enzymes whereas we also found indications for niche differentiation. These results confirm the complexity of mucin-driven microbiological ecological interactions and the intricate role of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the human gut mucus layer. ","This study investigates mucin-driven ecological interactions in a synthetic human gut community, revealing stable coexistence of specialist and generalist mucin degraders, cross-feeding relationships, and diverse metabolic outcomes, including butyrate production and methanogenesis."

Here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of four healthy subjects. Four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. Three were Ruminococcus strains and two were Bifidobacterium strains. Two Ruminococcus torques strains, IX-70 and VIII-239, produced blood group A- and H-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. The Bifidobacterium strains lacked A-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the A antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. Only Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268 produced blood group B-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of B antigenic chains. When this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group B salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. The glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. In contrast, none of 16 other fecal Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bifidobacterium strains produced ABH blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five S. faecalis strains. We conclude that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. These properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group H antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group A- or B-degrading glycosidases.","It is concluded that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidase including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases."

The molecular cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the gut play an important role in the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis and general health. Here, we studied the impact of a major Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells.

Methods and Results
Our results showed that R. gnavus E1 specifically increases the expression and the glycosylation level of the intestinal glyco-conjugates by goblet cells in the colonic mucosa of mono-associated mice with R. gnavus E1 as well as in human HT29-MTX cells. Such an effect was mediated through induction of the level of mRNA encoding for the major intestinal gel-forming mucin such as MUC2 and various glycosyltransferase enzymes.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time that R. gnavus E1 possess the ability to modulate the glycosylation profile of the glyco-conjugate molecules and mucus in goblet cells.

Significance and Impact of the Study
Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. gnavus E1 modified specifically the glycosylation pattern and MUC2 expression by means of a small soluble factor of peptidic nature (<3 kDa) and heat stable in the HT29-MTX cell.","The impact of a major Gram‐positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus, is studied on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells."

Fons, Res. Microbiol. 163:14–21, 2012). Here, we identified a novel GH36-encoding gene from the same strain and termed it aga2. Although aga1 showed a very simple genetic organization, aga2 is part of an operon of unique structure, including genes putatively encoding a regulator, a GH13, two phosphotransferase system (PTS) sequences, and a GH32, probably involved in extracellular and intracellular sucrose assimilation. The 727-amino-acid (aa) deduced Aga2 protein shares approximately 45% identity with Aga1. Both Aga1 and Aga2 expressed in Escherichia coli showed strict specificity for α-linked galactose. Both enzymes were active on natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. Aga1 and Aga2 occurred as homotetramers in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. Modeling of Aga1 and Aga2 identified key amino acids which may be involved in substrate specificity and stabilization of the α-linked galactoside substrates within the active site. Furthermore, Aga1 and Aga2 were both able to perform transglycosylation reactions with α-(1,6) regioselectivity, leading to the formation of product structures up to [Hex]12 and [Hex]8, respectively. We suggest that Aga1 and Aga2 play essential roles in the metabolism of dietary oligosaccharides and could be used for the design of galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotics, known to selectively modulate the beneficial gut microbiota.","It is suggested that Aga1 and Aga2 play essential roles in the metabolism of dietary oligosaccharides and could be used for the design of galacto-oligOSaccharide (GOS) prebiotics, known to selectively modulate the beneficial gut microbiota."

The faeces of five healthy adults were subjected to three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources. The bacterial community was compared before and after the enrichment by 16S rRNA gene profiling. Bacteria capable of fermenting sugars, such as Anaerotruncus, Holdemania, and Enterococcaceae likely took advantage of the carbohydrate chains.

Only three species of strict anaerobes able to grow on mucin were isolated from the enrichments of five different microbiota: Clostridium disporicum, Clostridium tertium, and Paraclostridium benzoelyticum.

Pangenome reconstruction of these strains revealed a remarkably mosaic architecture in which genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism are highly variable and bioinformatics data provide evidence of interspecies gene transfer that might explain this genomic heterogeneity. Global transcriptomic analyses suggest that the ability to utilize mucin has been lost in some lineages of B. ovatus and B. xylanisolvens, which still harbor residual gene clusters that are involved in mucin utilization by strains that still actively express this phenotype. Our data provide insight into the breadth and complexity of carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome and the underlying genomic events that shape these behaviors.","This article used a custom phenotyping array to determine carbohydrate utilization profiles for 354 members of the Bacteroidetes, a dominant saccharolytic phylum, and found that the ability to utilize dietary polysaccharides and endogenous mucin glycans was negatively correlated."

Yet, many of its bacterial constituents are functionally still largely unexplored. A crucial prerequisite for bacterial survival and proliferation is the creation and/or exploitation of an own niche. For many bacterial species that are linked to human disease, the inner mucus layer was found to be an important niche. Allobaculum mucolyticum is a newly identified, IBD-associated species that is thought be closely associated with the host epithelium. To explore how this bacterium is able to effectively colonize this niche, we screened its genome for factors that may contribute to mucosal colonization. Up to 60 genes encoding putative Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) were identified in the genome of A. mucolyticum. Mass spectrometry revealed 49 CAZymes of which 26 were significantly enriched in its secretome. Functional assays demonstrated the presence of CAZyme activity in A. mucolyticum conditioned medium, degradation of human mucin O-glycans, and utilization of liberated non-terminal monosaccharides for bacterial growth. The results support a model in which sialidases and fucosidases remove terminal O-glycan sugars enabling subsequent degradation and utilization of carbohydrates for A. mucolyticum growth. A. mucolyticum CAZyme secretion may thus facilitate bacterial colonization and degradation of the mucus layer and may pose an interesting target for future therapeutic intervention.","In this article, Allobaculum mucolyticum is identified as a newly identified, IBD-associated species that is thought be closely associated with the host epithelium."

Mucin glycan utilization requires the removal of protective caps, notably fucose and sialic acid, but the enzymatic details of this process remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the specificities of ten A. muciniphila glycoside hydrolases, which collectively remove all known sialyl and fucosyl mucin caps including those on double-sulfated epitopes. Structural analyses revealed an unprecedented fucosidase modular arrangement and explained the sialyl T-antigen specificity of a sialidase of a previously unknown family. Cell-attached sialidases and fucosidases displayed mucin-binding and their inhibition abolished growth of A. muciniphila on mucin. Remarkably, neither the sialic acid nor fucose contributed to A. muciniphila growth, but instead promoted butyrate production by co-cultured Clostridia. This study brings unprecedented mechanistic insight into the initiation of mucin O -glycan degradation by A. muciniphila and nutrient sharing between mucus-associated bacteria.

Mucins are complex glycoproteins that contain heavily sulfated O-glycans and form the protective colonic mucus layer. Bacterial carbohydrate sulfatases are required to metabolise these heavily sulfated mucin glycans and excessive bacterial foraging has been associated with several diseases. Sulfatases have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease, making these microbiota enzymes potential drug targets. A. muciniphila expresses carbohydrate sulfatases that can act on colonic mucins yet their roles in its metabolism remain opaque. Our data reveal that A. muciniphila requires glycopeptides/protein forms of colonic mucin for metabolism and its sulfatases have unique adaptations compared to Bacteroides species. Localisation studies reveal that desulfation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, but not D-galactose, is exclusively periplasmic. A cell surface sulfatase has a novel carbohydrate binding module that binds to colonic mucin. This paints a contrasting picture of sulfated mucin metabolism by Akkermansia muciniphila versus Bacteroides species.

Of 2,318 protein-coding genes in the genome, we identified 841 (40%) that were expressed at the protein level. Overall, proteins involved in energy production and carbohydrate metabolism indicate that A. muciniphila relies mainly on the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, and produces short-chain fatty acids through anaerobic fermentation in a nutrient-specific manner. Moreover, this bacterium possesses a broad repertoire of glycosyl hydrolases, together with putative peptidases and sulfatases, to cleave O-glycosylated mucin. Of them, putative mucin-degrading enzymes (Amuc_1220, Amuc_1120, Amuc_0052, Amuc_0480, and Amuc_0060) are highly abundant in the mucin-supplemented media. Furthermore, A. muciniphila uses mucin-derived monosaccharides as sources of energy and cell wall biogenesis.

Leveraging a tractable culture-based system to study how mucins influence oral microbial communities, we found that mucin glycans enable the coexistence of diverse microbes, while resisting disease-associated compositional shifts. Mucins from tissues with unique glycosylation differentially tuned microbial composition, as did isolated mucin glycan libraries, uncovering the importance of specific glycan patterns in microbiome modulation. We found that mucins shape microbial communities in several ways: serving as nutrients to support metabolic diversity, organizing spatial structure through reduced aggregation, and possibly limiting antagonism between competing taxa. Overall, this work identifies mucin glycans as a natural host mechanism and potential therapeutic intervention to maintain healthy microbial communities.

Here we report studies to determine whether degradation of mucin oligosaccharides is related to glycosidase production by bacteria growing in anaerobic fecal cultures. Triplicate cultures containing hog gastric mucin were inoculated with serially diluted feces from each of seven healthy subjects. When the stationary growth phase was attained, mucin oligosaccharide degradation and both cell-bound and extracellular activities of four glycosidases were measured in each culture. Cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase were present in bacteria growing at all levels of fecal inocula, including 10(-11) g. In contrast, extracellular activities were present in every culture inoculated with 10(-4)-10(-7) g feces, but were diminished or absent in cultures inoculated with 10(-8)-10(-11) g feces. Bacterial autolysis was an unlikely cause of extracellular glycosidase activity, since p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-fucosidase remained cell bound in cultures at every level of fecal inoculum. Degradation of mucin oligosaccharides was associated with extracellular, but not with cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase.

The addition of mucin caused a specific increase of A. muciniphila (±4.5 log increase over two days), far exceeding the response of other bacteria present, together with an increase in propionate. These findings suggest that colonisation and mucin degradation by A. muciniphila is dependent on pH and the concentration of mucin. Our results revealed the preference of A. muciniphila for the distal colon environment due to its higher pH and uncovered the quick and stable response of A. muciniphila to mucin supplementation.","It is suggested that colonisation and mucin degradation by A. muciniphila is dependent on pH and the concentration of mucin, and the preference for the distal compartment was found to be pH-dependent."

Bacteria colonizing the mucus layer have evolved to use mucin as a carbon and energy source. One of the members of the mucosa-associated microbiota is Akkermansia muciniphila, which is capable of producing an extensive repertoire of mucin-degrading enzymes. To further study the substrate utilization abilities of A. muciniphila, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model to test amino acid auxotrophy, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar-degrading capacities. The model-supported predictions were validated by in vitro experiments, which showed A. muciniphila to be able to utilize the mucin-derived monosaccharides fucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Growth was also observed on N-acetylgalactosamine, even though the metabolic model did not predict this. The uptake of these sugars, as well as the nonmucin sugar glucose, was enhanced in the presence of mucin, indicating that additional mucin-derived components are needed for optimal growth. An analysis of whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) comparing the gene expression of A. muciniphila grown on mucin with that of the same bacterium grown on glucose confirmed the activity of the genes involved in mucin degradation and revealed most of these to be upregulated in the presence of mucin. The transcriptional response was confirmed by a proteome analysis, altogether revealing a hierarchy in the use of sugars and reflecting the adaptation of A. muciniphila to the mucosal environment. In conclusion, these findings provide molecular insights into the lifestyle of A. muciniphila and further confirm its role as a mucin specialist in the gut.IMPORTANCEAkkermansia muciniphila is among the most abundant mucosal bacteria in humans and in a wide range of other animals. Recently, A. muciniphila has attracted considerable attention because of its capacity to protect against diet-induced obesity in mouse models. However, the physiology of A. muciniphila has not been studied in detail. Hence, we constructed a genome-scale model and describe its validation by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches on bacterial cells grown on mucus and glucose, a nonmucus sugar. The results provide detailed molecular insight into the mucus-degrading lifestyle of A. muciniphila and further confirm the role of this mucin specialist in producing propionate and acetate under conditions of the intestinal tract.","A genome-scale metabolic model is constructed and its validation by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches on bacterial cells grown on mucus and glucose, a nonmucus sugar provides detailed molecular insight into the mucus-degrading lifestyle of A. muciniphila and confirms its role as a mucin specialist in the gut."

Mucus degradation and fermentation by A. muciniphila are known to result in the liberation of oligosaccharides and subsequent production of acetate, which becomes directly available to microorganisms in the vicinity of the intestinal mucosa. Coculturing experiments of A. muciniphila with non-mucus-degrading butyrate-producing bacteria Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii resulted in syntrophic growth and production of butyrate. In addition, we demonstrate that the production of pseudovitamin B12 by E. hallii results in production of propionate by A. muciniphila, which suggests that this syntrophy is indeed bidirectional. These data are proof of concept for syntrophic and other symbiotic microbe-microbe interactions at the intestinal mucosal interface. The observed metabolic interactions between A. muciniphila and butyrogenic bacterial taxa support the existence of colonic vitamin and butyrate production pathways that are dependent on host glycan production and independent of dietary carbohydrates. We infer that the intestinal symbiont A. muciniphila can indirectly stimulate intestinal butyrate levels in the vicinity of the intestinal epithelial cells with potential health benefits to the host. IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiota is said to be a stable ecosystem where many networks between microorganisms are formed. Here we present a proof of principle study of microbial interaction at the intestinal mucus layer. We show that indigestible oligosaccharide chains within mucus become available for a broad range of intestinal microbes after degradation and liberation of sugars by the species Akkermansia muciniphila.

Complete genome sequencing revealed that, despite their large genomic similarity (>97.6%), the novel isolates clustered into two distinct subspecies of A. muciniphila: Amuc1, which includes the type-strain MucT, and AmucU, a cluster of unassigned strains that have not yet been well characterized.

These host-derived glycans are utilized by bacteria that have adapted to this specific compound in the gastrointestinal tract. Our study investigated the close interaction between two distinct gut microbiota members known to use mucus glycans, the generalist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the specialist Akkermansia muciniphila in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro study, in which mucin was the only nutrient source, indicated that B. thetaiotaomicron significantly upregulated genes coding for Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs) and mucin degradation activity when cultured in the presence of A. muciniphila. Furthermore, B. thetaiotaomicron significantly upregulated the expression of a gene encoding for membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain in co-culture. The transcriptome analysis also indicated that A. muciniphila was less affected by the environmental changes and was able to sustain its abundance in the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron while increasing the expression of LPS core biosynthesis activity encoding genes (O-antigen ligase, Lipid A and Glycosyl transferases) as well as ABC transporters. Using germ-free mice colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron and/or A. muciniphila, we observed a more general glycan degrading profile in B. thetaiotaomicron while the expression profile of A. muciniphila was not significantly affected when colonizing together, indicating that two different nutritional niches were established in mice gut.

This study investigated the transcriptional response during mucin-driven trophic interaction between the specialised mucin-degrader Akkermansia muciniphila and a butyrogenic gut commensal Anaerostipes caccae. A. muciniphila monocultures and co-cultures with non-mucolytic A. caccae from the Lachnospiraceae family were grown anaerobically in minimal media supplemented with mucin. We analysed for growth, metabolites (HPLC analysis), microbial composition (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), and transcriptional response (RNA-seq). Mucin degradation by A. muciniphila supported the growth of A. caccae and concomitant butyrate production predominantly via the acetyl-CoA pathway. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) showed the presence of A. caccae induced changes in the A. muciniphila transcriptional response with increased expression of mucin degradation genes and reduced expression of ribosomal genes. Two putative operons that encode for uncharacterised proteins and an efflux system, and several two-component systems were also differentially regulated. This indicated A. muciniphila changed its transcriptional regulation in response to A. caccae. This study provides insight to understand the mucin-driven microbial ecology using metatranscriptomics. Our findings show that the expression of mucolytic enzymes by A. muciniphila increases upon the presence of a community member.

However, it remains unknown how the expression of genes encoding extracellular proteins is regulated in response to dynamic mucosal environments. In this study, we elucidated the effect of mucin on the gene expression and probiotic traits of A. muciniphila. Transcriptome analysis showed that the genes encoding most mucin-degrading enzymes were significantly upregulated in the presence of mucin.

While P. aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins, saliva-derived anaerobes stimulated the growth of opportunistic pathogens when provided mucins as the sole carbon source. The fermentative metabolisms of these oral anaerobes generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during mucin enrichment in vitro, which were also found within expectorated sputum from CF patients. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened response to propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data support a central role for mucin fermentation in the carbon flux of the lower airways. More specifically, commensal oral bacteria may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to obtain carbon in the lung.","Data support a central role for mucin fermentation in the carbon flux of the lower airways and suggest commensal oral bacteria may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to obtain carbon in the lung."

The gel-forming component of mucus is mucin, a large polymeric glycoprotein. The present study examined the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica (with and without its virulence plasmid) in purified rabbit small intestinal mucin and the ability of bacteria to degrade mucin. Both virulent and nonvirulent organisms showed enhanced growth in mucin-supplemented media compared with unsupplemented media, but only at 37 degrees C and not at 25 degrees C. The effects of mucin were not specific because medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin also enhanced bacterial growth at 37 degrees C. Purified mucin was broken down into lower-molecular-weight components (assessed by monitoring its elution profile on a Sepharose CL-2B column) by plasmid-bearing Y. enterocolitica but not by plasmid-cured organisms. Culturing virulent Y. enterocolitica at 25 degrees C completely suppressed its capacity to degrade mucin, suggesting that this activity depends on plasmid expression. These results were confirmed in similar studies with purified rabbit colonic mucin. Mucin-degrading activity could be demonstrated in spent culture media from virulent Y. enterocolitica incubated at 37 degrees C but not in bacterial membrane preparations. Changes in the elution profiles of small intestinal and colonic mucins exposed to plasmid-bearing Y. enterocolitica at 37 degrees C were consistent with proteolytic depolymerization. The ability to grow well in mucin may help Y. enterocolitica to colonize the intestine, while the production of a mucin-degrading enzyme(s) by plasmid-bearing organisms may assist pathogenic strains to solubilize and penetrate the mucus gel layer.","The ability to grow well in mucin may help Y. enterocolitica to colonize the intestine, while the production of a mucin-degrading enzyme(s) by plasmid-bearing organisms may assist pathogenic strains to solubilize and penetrate the mucus gel layer."

Mucins from pig colon and stomach were prepared in their subunit forms for use as growth substrates, and the loss of the individual sugars from the mucins was measured after bacterial growth. Colonic mucin was more resistant to degradation than gastric mucin. The strains differed in their competence in degrading the mucins. Carbohydrate plus sulfate removal from gastric mucin varied from 63 to 76% for RS2, 37 to 46% for RS13, and 37 to 53% for RS42. All three strains removed more fucose (67 to 87%) and less sulfate (22 to 63%) than the average carbohydrate plus sulfate loss. Under the same conditions of growth, a mixed pig fecal culture removed 78% of sulfate and 96% of each sugar. Of the two major glycoprotein types present in the subunit pig gastric mucin preparation (R. A. Stanley, S. P. Lee, and A. M. Roberton, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 760:262-269, 1983), the less highly sulfated mucin was more susceptible to RS42 degradation. The degradation of gastric mucin by RS2 was not affected by glucose or high sulfate concentrations in the growth medium.

Metagenomic analyses of in vitro gut microbiome consortia revealed taxonomic profiles and genetic diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes that digest polysaccharides. Two independent consortia exhibited different abilities to produce acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid via the fermentation of polysaccharides derived from dietary fibers of grains and mushrooms.

These short-chain fatty acids affected morphological differentiation and mucin secretion in HT-29 human intestinal epithelial cells.

Recently, research on the MAM has gained momentum due to its significant role in immune and metabolic health. However, the study of the MAM is limited by conventional experimental techniques, as sampling this microbiome often requires invasive procedures, making in vivo research challenging. Additionally, obtaining samples from the MAM can compromise the lumen, complicating simultaneous studies of both the MAM and the lumen. To address these limitations, we present the TIM-2 muc , an advanced version of the colonic in vitro model TIM-2, which includes a mucus compartment comprising both colonic mucus beads - Gut 3 Beads and an electrospun sheet coated with Gut 3 Gel. To validate whether the integrated mucus compartment behaves like the in vivo MAM, we examined the bacterial composition, alpha and beta diversity, and the MAM’s composition compared to the lumen compartment of both the TIM-2 muc and the conventional TIM-2 model. Our findings suggest that the MAM in the TIM-2 muc model closely resembles its in vivo counterpart, thereby enhancing the physiological relevance of the luminal microbiome. TIM-2 muc , an advanced TIM-2 model, presents a novel, precise, standardized, and non-invasive method for studying the MAM and LM simultaneously.

In this study, we investigated whether the clinically tested VSL#3 probiotic formula and/or its secreted components can augment the protective mucus layer in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo studies, Wistar rats were orally administered the probiotic mixture VSL#3 on a daily basis for seven days. After treatment, basal luminal mucin content increased by 60%. In addition, we exposed isolated rat colonic loops to the VSL#3 probiotic formula, which significantly stimulated colonic mucin (MUC) secretion and MUC2 gene expression; however, MUC1 and MUC3 gene expression were only slightly elevated. The effect of the VSL#3 mucin secretagogue was also tested in vitro by use of LS 174T colonic epithelial cells. In contrast to the animal studies, cultured cells incubated with VSL#3 bacteria did not exhibit increased mucin secretion. However, the bacterial secreted products contained in the conditioned media stimulated a remarkable mucin secretion effect. Among the three bacterial groups (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococci) contained in VSL#3, the Lactobacillus species were the strongest potentiator of mucin secretion in vitro. A preliminary characterization of the putative mucin secretagogue suggested that it was a heat-resistant soluble compound, which is not sensitive to protease and DNase treatment.

Methods: Bacteria were sampled from healthy eyes and contact lenses from asymptomatic wearers. Intracellular mucins were extracted and purified from cadaver conjunctivas, and surface mucins from extended wear contact lenses. After exposure to bacteria, changes in mucin hydrodynamic volume (proteolytic cleavage) and subunit charge (oligosaccharide degradation) were assayed by size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography. The effect of mucin on bacterial replication was followed for up to 24 hours from the end of incubation with purified ocular mucins. Results: Ocular bacteria decreased the hydrodynamic volume of intracellular and contact lens adherent mucins, irrespective of glycosylation density. A decrease in mucin sialylation was observed after exposure to commensal bacteria. Subunit charge distributions were generally shifted to lesser negative charge, consistent with loss of charged epitopes. Subunits with high negative charge, observed after digesting lightly adhering contact lens mucins with bacteria, suggest preferential cleavage sites in the mucin molecule.

This barrier function is due in part to the extensive glycan structures found in mucus. Mucin protein is heavily O‐glycosylated with core structures containing α‐ and β‐ linked N‐acetyl‐galactosamine, N‐acetyl‐glucosamine, and galactose. These core structures are elongated and commonly modified by α‐linked fucose, sialic acid and sulfate residues. The sialic acid and sulfate residues protect the underlying mucin glycans from degradation. However, some gut microbes harbor glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) that enzymatically degrade mucin glycans. The released oligosaccharides can then be used as a primary carbohydrate source for the mucus‐associated microbiota.

They are associated with perturbation of the intestinal microbiota, and with alteration and crossing of the mucus barrier by the commensal bacteria that feed on it. In the process of mucus catabolism and invasion by gut bacteria, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play a critical role since mucus is mainly made up by O- and N-glycans. Moreover, the occurrence of IBD seems to be associated with low-fiber diets. Conversely, supplementation with oligosaccharides, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are structurally similar to intestinal mucins and could thus compete with them towards bacterial mucus-degrading CAZymes, has been suggested to prevent inflammation. In this mini-review, we will establish the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens, with a particular focus on the present technological opportunities available to further the discovery of mucus-degrading CAZymes within the entire gut microbiome, by coupling microfluidics with metagenomics and culturomics. Finally, we will discuss the challenges to overcome to better assess how CAZymes targeting specific functional oligosaccharides could be involved in the modulation of the mucus-driven cross-talk between gut bacteria and their host in the context of IBD.","In this article , the authors present the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens."

In the colon, mucus covering the epithelium is critical to maintain a homeostatic relationship with the gut microbiota by harboring a microbial community at safe distance from the epithelium surface. The mucin glycans composing the mucus layer provide binding sites and a sustainable source of nutrients to the bacteria inhabiting the mucus niche. Access to these glycan chains requires a complement of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) produced by bacteria across the phyla constituting the human gut microbiota. Due to the increased recognition of the role of mucus-associated microbes in human health, how commensal bacteria breakdown and utilize host mucin glycans has become of increased interest and is reviewed here. This short review provides an overview of the strategies evolved by gut commensal bacteria to access this rich source of the nutrient with a focus on the GHs involved in mucin degradation.","An overview of the strategies evolved by gut commensal bacteria to access this rich source of the nutrient with a focus on the GHs involved in mucin degradation is provided."

Some of these mucosal residents thrive on mucin glycoproteins that make up this layer. Mucin glycan degraders release mono- and oligosaccharides, and produce metabolites and gases that can be used by other inhabitants of the mucus layer through cross-feeding. In this thesis, I studied the collective mucin glycan degradation by a network of interacting microbes. To do that, I created a microbial mucin-degrading synthetic community (MDSC) and studied its composition and function during growth on mucin. This revealed that all mucin glycan degraders could co-exist, and that they could sustain butyrate-producing and hydrogen-consuming organisms. I show that a large number of diverse glycan-degrading enzymes encoded by different bacteria is involved in mucin glycan degradation. Throughout this thesis, specialist mucin glycan degrader Akkermansia muciniphila played a central role. When present from the start in a synthetic community growing on mucin, it was the dominant organism. Even when it was added after stabilisation of the synthetic community, to simulate probiotic treatment, A. muciniphila was able to colonise and persist. Furthermore, in a synthetic community that was designed to model the developing infant gut microbiota, the mucin specificity of A. muciniphila was again confirmed, as it only grew in the presence of mucin and not with any of the other substrates. A comparison of A. muciniphila to fellow specialist mucin glycan degrader Ruminococcus torques and glycan generalist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron revealed that each mucin glycan degrader has distinct preferences for specific mucin glycan structures. Consequently, growing the synthetic community on different mucin types affected community composition and function. This thesis demonstrates the utility of synthetic communities for microbial ecophysiological research, and contributes another piece to the puzzle of the ecological interactions that occur between the microbes that call the mucus layer their home. ","This study investigates mucin glycan degradation in synthetic communities of human gut microbes, revealing coexistence of mucin degraders and cross-feeding with other microbes, with Akkermansia muciniphila playing a central role in mucin specificity and community composition."

However, A. muciniphila is intractable to genetic analysis and thus the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolism of mucin, its colonization of the GI tract, and its impact on host physiology are poorly understood. Here, we developed and applied transposon mutagenesis to identify A. muciniphila factors important for the use of mucin and determined that mucin degradation products accumulate in internal compartments through a process that requires pili and a periplasmic protein complex. We further determined that the degradation of mucin and related proteoglycans is important for colonization of the GI by A. muciniphila but only in the context of competing microbes. In germ free mice, mucin use by A. muciniphila repressed the expression of host genes required for mevalonate and cholesterol biosynthesis in the colon, providing a molecular link between A. muciniphila metabolism of mucins, the regulation of lipid homeostasis and potential probiotic activities.

The thick intestinal mucus layer, especially in the colon, is the key barrier between the contents of the lumen and the epithelial cells, providing protection against infiltration by the microbiota as well potential pathogens. The upper layer of the colonic mucus is a niche for a subset of the microbiota which utilise the mucin glycoproteins as a nutrient source and mucin grazing by the microbiota appears to play a key role in maintaining barrier function as well as community stability. Despite the importance of mucin breakdown for gut health, the mechanisms by which gut bacteria access this complex glycoprotein are not well understood. The current model for mucin degradation involves exclusively exo-acting glycosidases that sequentially trim monosaccharides from the termini of the glycan chains to eventually allow access to the mucin peptide backbone by proteases. However, this model is in direct contrast to the Sus paradigm of glycan breakdown used by the Bacteroidetes which involves extracellular cleavage of glycans by surface located endo-acting enzymes prior to import of the oligosaccharide products. Here we describe the discovery and characterisation of endo-acting family 16 glycoside hydrolases (GH16s) from prominent mucin degrading gut bacteria that specifically target the oligosaccharide side chains of intestinal mucins from both animals and humans. These endo-acting O-glycanases display β1,4-glactosidase activity and in several cases are surface located indicating they are involved in the initial step in mucin breakdown.

Like microorganisms adapted to other complex nutrient environments, gut symbionts give different metabolic priorities to substrates present in mixtures. We investigated the responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common human intestinal bacterium that metabolizes more than a dozen different polysaccharides, including the O-linked glycans that are abundant in secreted mucin. Experiments in which mucin glycans were presented simultaneously with other carbohydrates show that degradation of these host carbohydrates is consistently repressed in the presence of alternative substrates, even by B. thetaiotaomicron previously acclimated to growth in pure mucin glycans. Experiments with media containing systematically varied carbohydrate cues and genetic mutants reveal that transcriptional repression of genes involved in mucin glycan metabolism is imposed by simple sugars and, in one example that was tested, is mediated through a small intergenic region in a transcript-autonomous fashion. Repression of mucin glycan-responsive gene clusters in two other human gut bacteria, Bacteroides massiliensis and Bacteroides fragilis, exhibited variable and sometimes reciprocal responses compared to those of B. thetaiotaomicron, revealing that these symbionts vary in their preference for mucin glycans and that these differences occur at the level of controlling individual gene clusters. Our results reveal that sensing and metabolic triaging of glycans are complex processes that vary among species, underscoring the idea that these phenomena are likely to be hidden drivers of microbiota community dynamics and may dictate which microorganisms preferentially commit to various niches in a constantly changing nutritional environment. IMPORTANCE Human intestinal microorganisms impact many aspects of health and disease, including digestion and the propensity to develop disorders such as inflammation and colon cancer. Complex carbohydrates are a major component of the intestinal habitat, and numerous species have evolved and refined strategies to compete for these coveted nutrients. Our findings reveal that individual bacteria exhibit different preferences for carbohydrates emanating from host diet and mucosal secretions and that some of these prioritization strategies are opposite to one another. Thus, we reveal new aspects of how individual bacteria, some with otherwise similar metabolic potential, partition to “preferred niches” in the complex gut ecosystem, which has important and immediate implications for understanding and predicting the behavioral dynamics of this community.","Investigating the responses of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a common human intestinal bacterium that metabolizes more than a dozen different polysaccharides, reveals new aspects of how individual bacteria partition to “preferred niches” in the complex gut ecosystem, which has important and immediate implications for understanding and predicting the behavioral dynamics of this community."

In particular, some gut bacteria have the ability to forage on glycans provided by the mucus layer covering the GI tract. The O-glycan structures present in mucin are diverse and complex, consisting predominantly of core 1-4 mucin-type O-glycans containing α- and β- linked N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine. These core structures are further elongated and frequently modified by fucose and sialic acid sugar residues via α1,2/3/4 and α2,3/6 linkages, respectively. The ability to metabolize these mucin O-linked oligosaccharides is likely to be a key factor in determining which bacterial species colonise the mucosal surface. Due to their proximity to the immune system, mucin-degrading bacteria are in a prime location to influence the host response. However, despite the growing number of bacterial genome sequences available from mucin degraders, our knowledge on the structural requirements for mucin degradation by gut bacteria remains fragmented. This is largely due to the limited number of functionally characterized enzymes and the lack of studies correlating the specificity of these enzymes with the ability of the strain to degrade and utilize mucin and mucin glycans. This review focuses on recent findings unravelling the molecular strategies used by mucin-degrading bacteria to utilise host glycans, adapt to the mucosal environment, and influence human health.","This review focuses on recent findings unraveling the molecular strategies used by mucin-degrading bacteria to utilize host glycans, adapt to the mucosal environment, and influence human health."

In recent years, a dozen carbohydrate-active enzymes from cultivated mucin degraders have been characterized. But yet, considering the fact that uncultured species predominate in the human gut microbiota, these biochemical data are far from exhaustive. In this study, we used functional metagenomics to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans. First, we performed a high-throughput screening of a fosmid metagenomic library constructed from the ileum mucosa microbiota using chromogenic substrates. The screening resulted in the isolation of 124 clones producing activities crucial in the degradation of human O- and N-glycans, namely sialidases, β-D-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, β-D-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase, and/or β-D-mannosidase. Thirteen of these clones were selected based on their diversified functional profiles and were further analyzed on a secondary screening. This step consisted of lectin binding assays to demonstrate the ability of the clones to degrade human intestinal mucus. In total, the structural modification of several mucin motifs, sialylated mucin ones in particular, was evidenced for nine clones. Sequencing their metagenomic loci highlighted complex catabolic pathways involving the complementary functions of glycan sensing, transport, hydrolysis, deacetylation, and deamination, which were sometimes associated with amino acid metabolism machinery. These loci are assigned to several Bacteroides and Feacalibacterium species highly prevalent and abundant in the gut microbiome and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans.","Functional metagenomics is used to identify new metabolic pathways in uncultured bacteria involved in harvesting mucin glycans and explain the metabolic flexibility of gut bacteria feeding both on dietary and human glycans."

Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins serve as a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we investigate the potential role of purified, orally administered mucus glycans in maintaining a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and purified O-linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found that porcine mucin glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar resident microbes. We demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic treatment, suppress Clostridium difficile abundance, delay the onset of diet-induced obesity, and increase the relative abundance of resident Akkermansia muciniphila. In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with mucus utilization are abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare in enteric pathogens, consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being selected for during host development and throughout the evolution of the host–microbe relationship. Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology.","This study liberated and purified O -linked glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model, and identified mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits to host physiology."

Here we describe the discovery and characterisation of endo-acting enzymes from prominent mucin-degrading bacteria that target the polyLacNAc structures within oligosaccharide side chains of both animal and human mucins. These O-glycanases are part of the large and diverse glycoside hydrolase 16 (GH16) family and are often lipoproteins, indicating that they are surface located and thus likely involved in the initial step in mucin breakdown.

Despite that adhesion to mucins is considered critical for the persistence of A. muciniphila in the human intestinal tract, our knowledge of how this intestinal symbiont recognizes and binds to mucins is still limited. Here, we first show that the mucin-binding properties of A. muciniphila are independent of environmental oxygen concentrations and not abolished by pasteurization. We then dissected the mucin-binding properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila by use of a recently developed cell-based mucin array that enables display of the tandem repeats of human mucins with distinct O -glycan patterns and structures. We found that A. muciniphila recognizes the unsialylated LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-R) disaccharide selectively on core2 and core3 O -glycans. This disaccharide epitope is abundantly found on human colonic mucins capped by sialic acids, and we demonstrated that endogenous A. muciniphila neuraminidase activity can uncover the epitope and promote binding. In summary, our study provides insights into the mucin-binding properties important for colonization of a key mucin-foraging bacterium.

Here, we leverage a functionally characterized, 14-member synthetic human microbiota in gnotobiotic mice to deduce which bacteria and functions are responsible for the pathogen susceptibility. Using strain dropouts of mucolytic bacteria from the community, we show that Akkermansia muciniphila renders the host more vulnerable to the mucosal pathogen during fiber deprivation. However, the presence of A. muciniphila reduces pathogen load on a fiber-sufficient diet, highlighting the context-dependent beneficial effects of this mucin specialist. The enhanced pathogen susceptibility is not owing to altered host immune or pathogen responses, but is driven by a combination of increased mucus penetrability and altered activities of A. muciniphila and other community members.

Gut microbiota has been causatively linked with the development of both metabolic dysfunctions and gastrointestinal disorders, thus gut dysbiosis in IBS may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. Here, we showed that human gut bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus play a pathogenic role in gut dysbiosis-induced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and IBS. Monoassociation of R. gnavus impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose control in germ-free mice. Mechanistically, treatment of R. gnavus -derived metabolites tryptamine and phenethylamine directly impaired insulin signaling in major metabolic tissues of healthy mice and monkeys and this effect was mediated by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling axis. Moreover, we showed levels of R. gnavus , tryptamine and phenethylamine are positively associated with insulin resistance in T2D patients and IBS patients. Our findings suggest a causal role for tryptamine/phenethylamine-producers in the development of insulin resistance, provide molecular mechanisms for the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in IBS, and highlight the TAAR1 signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome induced by gut dysbiosis.

Akkermansia muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. are commensal microbes colonising the mucus gel layer of the colon. Both species have the capacity to utilise colonic mucin as a substrate. A. muciniphila degrades colonic mucin, while Desulfovibrio spp. metabolise the sulfate moiety of sulfated mucins. Altered abundances of these microorganisms have been reported in ulcerative colitis (UC). However their capacity to bind to human colonic mucin, and whether this binding capacity is affected by changes in mucin associated with UC, remain to be defined.
Methods 
Mucin was isolated from resected colon from control patients undergoing resection for colonic cancer (n = 7) and patients undergoing resection for UC (n = 5). Isolated mucin was purified and printed onto mucin microarrays. Binding of reference strains and three clinical isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. to purified mucin was investigated.
Results 
Both A. muciniphila and Desulfovibro spp. bound to mucin. The reference strain and all clinical isolates of A. muciniphila showed increased binding capacity for UC mucin (p < .005). The Desulfovibrio reference strain showed increased affinity for UC mucin. The mucin binding profiles of clinical isolates of Desulfovibrio spp. were specific to each isolate. Two isolates showed no difference in binding. One UC isolate bound with increased affinity to UC mucin (p < .005).
Conclusion

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify the nutrient utilization- and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production potential of gut microbes in infants during the first year of life. Stool samples were obtained from mothers at 18 weeks of pregnancy and from infants at birth (first stool) at 3, 6, and 12-months of age from the general population-based PreventADALL cohort. We identified the taxonomic and SCFA composition in 100 mother-child pairs. The SCFA production and substrate utilization potential of gut microbes were observed by multiomics (shotgun sequencing and proteomics) on six infants. We found a four-fold increase in relative butyrate levels from 6 to 12 months of infant age. The increase was correlated to Eubacterium rectale and its bacterial network, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii relative abundance, while low butyrate at 12 months was correlated to Ruminococcus gnavus and its associated network of bacteria. Both E. rectale and F. prausnitzii expressed enzymes needed for butyrate production and enzymes related to dietary fiber degradation, while R. gnavus expressed mucus-, fucose, and human milk oligosaccharides (HMO)-related degradation enzymes. Therefore, we believe that the presence of E. rectale, its network, and F. prausnitzii are key bacteria in the transition from an infant- to an adult-like gut microbiota with respect to butyrate production. Our results indicate that the transition from an infant- to an adult-like gut microbiota with respect to butyrate producing bacteria, occurs between 6 and 12 months of infant age. The bacteria associated with the increased butyrate ratio/levels were E. rectale and F. prausnitzii, which potentially utilize a variety of dietary fibers based on the glycoside hydrolases (GHs) expressed. R. gnavus with a negative association to butyrate potentially utilizes mucin, fucose, and HMO components. This knowledge could have future importance in understanding how microbial metabolites can impact infant health and development.","The results indicate that the transition from an infant- to an adult-like gut microbiota with respect to butyrate producing bacteria, occurs between 6 and 12 months of infant age."

In addition, many previously uncharacterized mucin degraders were isolated from faecals samples, suggesting the mucin-degrading gut commensals were underappreciated. To gain a better understanding of the interaction between these mucin-degrading gut commensals and the host, the effect of the commensals on intestinal epithelial cells were examined, and the results revealed that the commensals (8 Bacteroides spp., 2 Parabacteroides spp, Akkermanisa muciniphila and Bifidobacterial dentium) incited low level of inflammatory response (IL-8 and TNF-α) but suppressed the inflammatory response induced by E. coli through downregulating the NF-κB pathway. The presence of gut commensals also showed potential in enhancing the epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier function through regulating the mRNA expression of TJ protein genes such as Zo-1, Occludin, Claudin-1 and E-cadherin. Furthermore, the presence of commensal bacteria P. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron and A. muciniphila completely or partly restored the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β induced TJ barrier disruption.

Disrupted microbiome has been associated with negative health outcomes and especially could promote the onset of enteric infections. To sustain their growth and persistence within the human digestive tract, gut microbes and enteric pathogens rely on two main polysaccharide compartments, namely dietary fibers and mucus carbohydrates. Several evidences suggest that the three-way relationship between gut microbiota, dietary fibers and mucus layer could unravel the capacity of enteric pathogens to colonise the human digestive tract and ultimately lead to infection. The review starts by shedding light on similarities and differences between dietary fibers and mucus carbohydrates structures and functions. Next, we provide an overview of the interactions of these two components with the third partner, namely, the gut microbiota, under health and disease situations. The review will then provide insights into the relevance of using dietary fibers interventions to prevent enteric infections with a focus on gut microbial imbalance and impaired-mucus integrity. Facing the numerous challenges in studying microbiota-pathogen-dietary fiber-mucus interactions, we lastly describe the characteristics and potentialities of currently available in vitro models of the human gut.","The characteristics and potentialities of currently available in vitro models of the human gut are described, including microbiota-pathogen-dietary fiber-mucus interactions, to provide insights into the relevance of using dietary fibers interventions to prevent enteric infections."

However, the physiological effects of repeated – but not recent – antibiotic usage on microbiota-mediated mucosal barrier function are largely unknown. By selecting human individuals from the deeply-phenotyped Estonian Microbiome Cohort (EstMB) we here utilised human-to-mouse faecal microbiota transplantation to explore long-term impacts of repeated antibiotic use on intestinal mucus function. While a healthy mucus layer protects the intestinal epithelium against infection and inflammation, using ex-vivo mucus function analyses of viable colonic tissue explants, we show that microbiota from humans with a history of repeated antibiotic use causes reduced mucus growth rate and increased mucus penetrability compared to healthy controls in the transplanted mice. Moreover, shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified a significantly altered microbiota composition in the antibiotic-shaped microbial community, with known mucus-utilising bacteria, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides fragilis, dominating in the gut. The altered microbiota composition was further characterised by a distinct metabolite profile, which may be caused by differential mucus degradation capacity. Consequently, our findings suggest that long-term antibiotic use in humans results in an altered microbial community that has reduced capacity to maintain proper mucus function in the gut.","Repeated antibiotic usage leads to microbiota-dependent mucus defects, altering the gut microbiota composition and function."

The advent of metagenomics has linked R. gnavus with various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, and diabetes mellitus (DM), which has become a growing area of investigation. The initial focus of research primarily centered on assessing the abundance of R. gnavus and its potential association with disease presentation, taking into account variations in sample size, sequencing and analysis methods. However, recent investigations have shifted towards elucidating the underlying mechanistic pathways through which R. gnavus may contribute to disease manifestation. In this comprehensive review, we aim to provide an updated synthesis of the current literature on R. gnavus in the context of IBD, obesity, and DM. We critically analyze relevant studies and summarize the potential molecular mediators implicated in the association between R. gnavus and these diseases. Across numerous studies, various molecules such as methylation-controlled J (MCJ), glucopolysaccharides, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), interleukin(IL)-10, IL-17, and capric acid have been proposed as potential contributors to the link between R. gnavus and IBD. Similarly, in the realm of obesity, molecules such as hydrogen peroxide, butyrate, and UDCA have been suggested as potential mediators, while glycine ursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) has been implicated in the connection between R. gnavus and DM. Furthermore, it is imperative to emphasize the necessity for additional studies to evaluate the potential efficacy of targeting pathways associated with R. gnavus as a viable strategy for managing these diseases.

Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes. We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes were analyzed using PanPhlAn. We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients. To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R. gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199 IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut. This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD.","This study finds a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD."

The outer mucus layer in the large intestine forms a niche that attracts specific gut microbiota members of which several gut commensals can degrade mucin. Mucin glycan degradation is a complex process that requires a broad range of glycan degrading enzymes, as mucin glycans are intricate and diverse molecules. Consequently, it is hypothesized that microbial mucin breakdown requires concerted action of various enzymes in a network of multiple resident microbes in the gut mucosa. This review investigates the evolutionary relationships of microbial carbohydrate-active enzymes that are potentially involved in mucin glycan degradation and focuses on the role that microbial enzymes play in the degradation of gut mucin glycans in microbial cross-feeding and syntrophic interactions.","This review explores the role of microbial glycosyl hydrolases in gut mucosa, investigating evolutionary relationships and their involvement in mucin glycan degradation, microbial cross-feeding, and syntrophic interactions in the gut microbiota."

Schroeder","10.1093/GASTRO/GOY052","","The intestinal tract is inhabited by a tremendous number of microorganisms, termed the gut microbiota. These microorganisms live in a mutualistic relationship with their host and assist in the degradation of complex carbohydrates. Although the gut microbiota is generally considered beneficial, the vast number of microbial cells also form a permanent threat to the host. Thus, the intestinal epithelium is covered with a dense layer of mucus to prevent translocation of the gut microbiota into underlying tissues. Intestinal mucus is an organized glycoprotein network with a host-specific glycan structure. While the mucus layer has long been considered a passive, host-designed barrier, recent studies showed that maturation and function of the mucus layer are strongly influenced by the gut microbiota. In return, the glycan repertoire of mucins can select for distinct mucosa-associated bacteria that are able to bind or degrade specific mucin glycans as a nutrient source. Because the intestinal mucus layer is at the crucial interface between host and microbes, its breakdown leads to gut bacterial encroachment that can eventually cause inflammation and infection. Accordingly, a dysfunctional mucus layer has been observed in colitis in mice and humans. Moreover, the increased consumption of a low-fiber Western-style diet in our modern society has recently been demonstrated to cause bacteria-mediated defects of the intestinal mucus layer. Here, I will review current knowledge on the interaction between gut bacteria and the intestinal mucus layer in health and disease.

Central to their survival is the ability to metabolise complex dietary and host-derived glycans including intestinal mucins. The latter are critical components of the gut epithelium glycocalyx and mucus barriers, essential for microbiota-gut homeostasis and protection from infections by pathogens. The prominent and model human gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) is a versatile and highly efficient complex glycan degrader thanks to the expansion of gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilisation loci (PULs) in its genome. While the mechanisms for several singular dietary glycan-induced PULs have been elucidated, studies on the 16-18 mucin-induced PULs in B. theta significantly lag behind. A combination of the scale and complexity of B. theta transcriptomic response to mucins and complex glycan configurations of mucins represent major hurdles for the functional characterisation of the mucin induced PULs. As a result, there is very limited knowledge on how mucin metabolism is coordinated in B. theta and what specific PULs, genes and metabolites are critical for mucin-B. theta, and more generally mucin-microbiota interactions and their importance in microbiota-gut homeostasis. Here we show that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50, (i) encodes activities consistent with a machinery that couples the processing of mucin-O glycan glycoproteins with the metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), an abundant mucin O-glycan sugar; (ii) is important for competitive growth on mucins in-vitro; (iii) encodes a key kinase enzyme (BT4240) that is critical for GalNAc metabolism and (iv) has related PULs encoded by a range of prominent Bacteroides species in the human gut. Furthermore, BT4240 kinase was also critical for glycosaminoglycan metabolism, thus extending the PULs function beyond mucins. Our work advances our understanding of the vital metabolic processes that govern mucosal glycoprotein metabolism and by implication, a key aspect of host-microbiota interactions at mucosal surfaces and highlight GalNAc as a key metabolite targeted for competitive growth.","This work shows that a mucin inducible PUL BT4240-50 encodes activities consistent with a machinery that couples the processing of mucin-O glycan glycoproteins with the metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), an abundant mucin O-glycan sugar that is important for competitive growth on mucins in-vitro."

This study aimed to use quantitative analyses to investigate the diet-induced imbalance of mucosal homeostasis. Seven days of fiber-deficiency affected intestinal anatomy and physiology, seen by reduced intestinal length and loss of the colonic crypt-structure. Moreover, the mucus layer was diminished, muc2 expression decreased, and impaired mucus secretion was detected by stable isotope probing. Quantitative microbiome profiling of the gut microbiota showed a diet-induced reduction in bacterial load and decreased diversity across the intestinal tract, including taxa with fiber-degrading and butyrate-producing capabilities. Most importantly, there was little change in the absolute abundance of known mucus-degrading bacteria, although, due to the general loss of taxa, relative abundance would erroneously indicate an increase in mucus degraders.

However, the genetic factors that establish gut colonization and virulence remain elusive due to the lack of a system for genetic modification. This study develops several genetic tools, including a shuttle vector, an inducible promoter, fluorescent proteins, and gene disruption or deletion systems in R. gnavus to identify the genes involved in R. gnavus colonization. Using these genetic tools, we found the respective sortase enzymes necessary for both cell wall localization of the superantigens and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) production in R. gnavus ATCC 29149. We identified the putative new gene cluster responsible for CPS production in the adjacent region of the sortase gene and confirmed that CPS production is crucial for competitive fitness during colonization in germ-free mouse intestines and that CPS production is inversely correlated with the inflammatory activity of R. gnavus . Furthermore, CPS cluster-possessing strains tended to be more prevalent in healthy human isolates compared to those from Crohn’s disease patients. This implies that CPS production is involved in their inflammatory activities and pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as IBD.

Predominantly composed of mucin 2 (MUC2), a glycosylation-rich protein, the mucus layer forms a gel-like coating that covers the colonic epithelium surface. This layer provides a habitat for intestinal microorganisms, which can utilize mucin glycans present in the mucus layer as a sustainable source of nutrients. Additionally, metabolites produced by the microbiota during the metabolism of mucus glycans have a profound impact on host health. Under normal conditions, the production and consumption of mucus maintain a dynamic balance. However, several studies have demonstrated that certain factors, such as dietary fiber deficiency, can enhance the metabolism of mucus glycans by gut bacteria, thereby disturbing this balance and weakening the mucus barrier function of the mucus layer. To better understand the occurrence and development of colon-related diseases, it is crucial to investigate the complex metabolic patterns of mucus glycosylation by intestinal microorganisms. Our objective was to comprehensively review these patterns in order to clarify the effects of mucus layer glycan metabolism by intestinal microorganisms on the host.

Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes. We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes were analyzed using PanPhlAn. We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients. To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R. gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199 IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut. This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD.","In this article, the authors performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples) and identified strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes."

The molecular scaffolding of mucus comprises hydrated mucins, which are very high-molecular mass, glycosylated glycoproteins presenting arrays of O-linked glycans. Mucins are integral to microbial interactions with epithelial surfaces and have potential roles in microbial trophism, the presentation of ligands to block microbial binding or stabilize colonization and the provision of feedstocks for microbial metabolism. The protective physicochemical properties of mucus are attributable to their high carbohydrate content. Microbes are capable of expressing specific lectins and mucin-degrading enzymes to engage with, utilize, and penetrate mucus gels. Normally, the dynamic nature of such gels represents an optimal adaptation through host–microbial crosstalk, enabling the maintenance of barrier function through the coregulation of mucus turnover and microbial ecology. Mucin expression and glycosylation are biologically responsive to changes in the sub- and supra-mucosal environment and are significantly influenced by inflammation and microbial colonization. Impairment of mucus gel turnover may lead to abnormal colonization, inflammatory pathology, and biofilm formation.","Mucin expression and glycosylation are biologically responsive to changes in the sub- and supra-mucosal environment and are significantly influenced by inflammation and microbial colonization."

Gut microbiota-mucosa-epithelial cells co-exist in an intricate three-way relationship that underpins gut homeostasis, and ultimately influences health and disease conditions. The O-glycans of mucin glycoproteins have been uncovered as a centrepiece of this system, although understanding the phenomena at play at the molecular level has been challenging and subject to significant traction over the last years. The purpose of this review is to discuss the recent advances in the phenomena that mediate microbiota and mucus multidirectional interactions in the human gut.


RECENT FINDINGS
The mucus biosynthesis and degradation by both commensal and pathogenic bacteria is under tight regulation and involves hundreds of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and transporters. The fucosylation of O-glycans from mucin-2 seems to dictate binding by pathogenic species and to influence their virulence. Less clear is the influence of O-glycans in quorum sensing and biofilm formation. We have reviewed the advances in the in vitro models available to recreate the phenomena that capture the physiological context of the intestinal environment, emphasising models that include mucus and other aspects relevant to the physiological context.


SUMMARY
The recent findings highlight the importance of merging advances in analytical (glycans analysis) and omics techniques along with original robust in vitro models that enable to deconstruct part of the high complexity of the living gut and expand our understanding of the microbes-mucosa relationships and their significance in health and disease.","The recent findings highlight the importance of merging advances in analytical (glycans analysis) and omics techniques along with original robust in vitro models that enable to deconstruct part of the high complexity of the living gut and expand the understanding of the microbes-mucosa relationships and their significance in health and disease."

Regenerating islet-derived protein 3 γ (Reg3γ), the archetypal intestinal antimicrobial peptide, is critical for maintaining host-microbe interactions. Expression of Reg3γ is known to be regulated by the microbiota through two different pathways, although it remains unknown whether specific Reg3γ-inducing bacteria act via one or both of these pathways. In recent work, we identified Ruminococcus gnavus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri as commensal bacteria able to induce Reg3g expression. In this study, we show these bacteria require myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 and group 3 innate lymphoid cells for induction of Reg3γ in mice. Interestingly, we find that R. gnavus and L. reuteri suppress Reg3γ in the absence of either myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 or group 3 innate lymphoid cells. In addition, we demonstrate that colonization by these bacteria is not required for induction of Reg3γ, which occurs several days after transient exposure to the organisms.

Using an approach that combines in situ hybridization, laser microdissection and 16s rRNA sequencing of spatially distinct regions of the mouse gut lumen, we discovered that a dense microbial community resembling a biofilm is embedded in the mucus layer. The mucus associated biofilm-like community excluded bacteria belonging to phylum Proteobacteria. Additionally, it was significantly more diverse and consisted of bacterial species that were unique to it. By employing germ-free mice deficient in T and B lymphocytes we found that formation of biofilm-like structure was independent of adaptive immunity. Instead the integrity of biofilm-like community depended on Gram-positive commensals such as Clostridia. Additionally, biofilm-like community in the mucus lost fewer Clostridia and showed smaller bloom of Proteobacteria compared to the lumen upon antibiotic treatment. When subjected to time restricted feeding biofilm like structure significantly enhanced in size and showed enrichment of Clostridia. Taken together our work discloses that mucus associated biofilm-like community represent a specialized community that is structurally and compositionally distinct that excludes aerobic bacteria while enriching for anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridia, exhibits enhanced stability to antibiotic treatment and that can be modulated by dietary changes.","This work discloses that mucus associated biofilm-like community represent a specialized community that is structurally and compositionally distinct that excludes aerobic bacteria while enriching for anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridia, exhibits enhanced stability to antibiotic treatment and that can be modulated by dietary changes."

Normal functioning of this barrier is central in diverse physiological processes including digestion, immunity, inflammation, and gut-brain signaling. One crucial component of the barrier is the mucus layer covering the epithelium. There is increased appreciation of the importance of mucus in maintenance of the gut barrier, and how dysregulation of the mucus layer contributes to several common gastrointestinal pathologies.

Despite the high density of bacteria that colonize the lower airways, nutrient sources that sustain bacterial growth in vivo, and how those nutrients are derived, are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the possibility that mucins serve as an important carbon reservoir for the CF lung microbiota. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins in isolation, we found that anaerobic, mucin-fermenting bacteria could stimulate the robust growth of CF pathogens when provided intact mucins as a sole carbon source. 16S rRNA sequencing and enrichment culturing of sputum also identified that mucin-degrading anaerobes are ubiquitous in the airways of CF patients. The collective fermentative metabolism of these mucin-degrading communities in vitro generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during growth on mucin, and the same metabolites were also found in abundance within expectorated sputum. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened expression of genes required for the catabolism of propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data provide evidence for an important role of mucin fermenting bacteria in the carbon flux of the lower airways.

Various gut microbial species possess diverse hydrolytic enzymes and catabolic pathways for breaking down mucin glycans, resulting in competition for the limited nutrients within the gut environment. Adherence to mucin glycans represents a crucial strategy used by gut microbes to access nutrient reservoirs. Understanding these properties is pivotal for comprehending the survival mechanisms of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. However, characterization of individual strains within the vast array of coexisting bacteria in the microbiome is challenging. To investigate this, we developed mucin-immobilized particles by immobilizing porcine gastric mucin (PGM) onto glass beads chemically modified with boronic acid. These PGM-immobilized particles were then anaerobically cultured with human fecal microbiota, and the bacteria adhering to PGM were isolated. Interestingly, the microbiome composition remained largely unchanged irrespective of PGM immobilization. Nonetheless, bacteria isolated from PGM-immobilized glass particles exhibited notably higher N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity compared to the control beads. Furthermore, Bacteroides strains isolated from PGM-immobilized glass particles displayed enhanced adhesive and metabolic properties to PGM. These findings underscore the utility of PGM particles in enriching and isolating specific microbes. Moreover, they highlight substantial differences in microbial properties at the strain level. We anticipate that PGM-immobilized particles will advance culture-based microbiome research, emphasizing the significance of strain-level characterization.


IMPORTANCE
Metabolism of mucin glycans by gut bacteria represents a crucial strategy for accessing nutrient reservoirs. The efficacy of mucin glycan utilization among gut bacteria hinges on the metabolic capabilities of individual strains, necessitating meticulous strain-level characterization. In this investigation, we used glass beads chemically immobilized with mucins to selectively enrich bacteria from fecal fermentation cultures, based on their superior adhesion to and metabolism of mucin glycoproteins. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that the physical interactions between bacteria and mucin glycoprotein components directly correlate with their capacity to utilize mucins as nutrient sources. Furthermore, our study implies that physical proximity may significantly influence bacterial nutrient acquisition within the ecosystem, facilitating gut bacteria's access to carbohydrate components.","Researchers developed mucin-immobilized particles to study gut microbiome diversity, finding that specific bacteria strains exhibit enhanced adhesive and metabolic properties to mucin, highlighting the importance of strain-level characterization in understanding gut bacteria's nutrient acquisition strategies."

Here, the O -glycan profile of the colonic mucosa and gut microbiome were investigated in C57BL/6J mice fed six structurally diverse dietary polysaccharides and a mixture of six fibers. Dietary polysaccharides increased total O -glycans, mainly by stimulating neutral glycans. Highly branched arabinogalactan promoted terminally fucosylated core 1 O -glycans; whereas linear polysaccharides, including pectin, konjac glucomannan, inulin, and the fiber mixture, favored terminally di-fucosylated O -glycans. The last three polysaccharides also lowered the level of sulfated O -glycans and sialylated mono-fucosylated O -glycans. Varied monosaccharide composition in mixed polysaccharides had a synergistic beneficial effect, boosting fucosylated neutral glycans, decreasing acidic glycans, and stimulating microbial richness and diversity. Dietary polysaccharides containing arabinose and sulfate groups enhanced the relative abundances of Akkermansia and Muribaculaceae , respectively. The present comparison reveals the relationship between dietary polysaccharide structure, mucin O -glycan composition, and intestinal microorganisms.

The humanized gnotobiotic mice mimic humans with a nonsecretor phenotype due to knockout of their α1–2 fucosyltransferase (Fut2) gene. The fecal microbiota of Fut2− mice that lack fucosylated host glycans show decreased alpha diversity relative to Fut2+ mice and exhibit significant differences in community composition. A glucose-rich plant polysaccharide-deficient (PD) diet exerted a strong effect on the microbiota membership but eliminated the effect of Fut2 genotype. Additionally fecal metabolites predicted host genotype in mice on a polysaccharide-rich standard diet but not on a PD diet. A more detailed mechanistic analysis of these interactions involved colonization of gnotobiotic Fut2+ and Fut2− mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent member of the human gut microbiota known to adaptively forage host mucosal glycans when dietary polysaccharides are absent. Within Fut2− mice, the B. thetaiotaomicron fucose catabolic pathway was markedly down-regulated, whereas BT4241–4247, an operon responsive to terminal β-galactose, the precursor that accumulates in the Fut2− mice, was significantly up-regulated. These changes in B. thetaiotaomicron gene expression were only evident in mice fed a PD diet, wherein B. thetaiotaomicron relies on host mucus consumption.

While postbiotics are considered safer alternatives to fiber for susceptible patients, their mechanistic effects on a fiber-deprived gut remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in a mouse model that a fermented postbiotic, alone or in combination with a prebiotic and aloe vera, counteracted the increase of detrimental properties of the microbiota on a fiber-free diet. The supplement regimen reshaped the gut microbiota, counteracting the expansion of key mucin-degrading bacteria, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides goldsteinii. Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed this compositional change corresponded to a community-wide functional pivot away from expressing mucinolytic enzymes, such as sialidases, and towards utilizing alternative substrates. These microbial shifts recapitulated the effects of dietary fiber reintroduction and translated to direct host benefits, including sustentation of the colonic mucus layer and attenuation of diet-induced type III immune cytokine expression.

Our objective is to characterize the influence of dietary fiber and mucin supply on the abundance of mucin-degrading species within the gut ecosystem. Current mathematical gut reactor models that include the enzymatic degradation of glycans do not differentiate between glycan types and their degraders. The model we present distinguishes between a generalist that can degrade both dietary fiber and mucin, and a specialist species that can only degrade mucin. The integrity of the colonic mucus barrier is essential for overall human health and well-being, with the mucin specialist Akkermanisa muciniphila being associated with a healthy mucus layer. Competition, particularly between the specialist and generalists like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, may lead to mucus layer erosion, especially during periods of dietary fiber deprivation. Our model treats the colon as a gut reactor system, dividing it into two compartments that represent the lumen and the mucus of the gut, resulting in a complex system of ordinary differential equations with a large and uncertain parameter space. To understand the influence of model parameters on long-term behavior, we employ a random forest classifier, a supervised machine learning method. Additionally, a variance-based sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the sensitivity of steady-state values to changes in model parameter inputs.

This review examines the dualistic nature of A. muciniphila mucin degradation, exploring its potential benefits and risks. As a mucin specialist, A. muciniphila uses glycosyl hydrolases and mucinases to degrade mucins, producing metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), succinate, and other compounds. These metabolites benefit host health and cross-feed other commensal microbes, such as butyrate producers. A. muciniphila levels are inversely correlated with several disease states, such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory states, and administration of A. muciniphila has been found by several groups to restore and maintain gut homeostasis. However, under certain conditions, such as low dietary fiber or conditions with an altered gut microbiota, excessive mucin degradation by A. muciniphila can compromise the mucus barrier, increasing susceptibility to inflammation, infection, and pathogenic overgrowth. Elevated A. muciniphila levels have been associated with various diseases and medications, including graft versus host disease (GVHD) and irradiation, and shown to exacerbate infections by enteric pathogens. The context-dependent effects of A. muciniphila and mucin degradation underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of its interactions with the host and microbial community. This review aims to provide a balanced perspective on the implications of gut microbial mucus degradation, highlighting that it can be good, and it can be bad depending on the context.

Here, we used an array of omics techniques including glycomics to examine the effect of dietary fiber consumption on the gut microbiota, colonic mucin O-glycosylation and host physiology of high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. The high-fat diet group had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and altered liver proteome, gut microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid production compared to normal chow diet group. While dietary fiber inclusion did not reverse all high fat-induced modifications, it resulted in specific changes, including an increase in the relative abundance of bacterial families with known fiber digesters and a higher propionate concentration. Conversely, colonic mucin O-glycosylation remained similar between the normal chow and high-fat diet groups, while dietary fiber intervention resulted in major alterations in O-glycosylation. Correlation network analysis revealed previously undescribed associations between specific bacteria and mucin glycan structures. For example, the relative abundance of the bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis positively correlated with glycan structures containing one terminal fucose and correlated negatively with glycans containing two terminal fucose residues or with both an N-acetylneuraminic acid and a sulfate residue.

Mucins are decorated in a diverse array of O-glycans, providing nutrients and attachment sites for microbes. Dysbiosis of the microbiota, and alterations in mucin glycosylation have been associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, the causal relationship between these two factors remains unclear. Here, we employed a multidisciplinary approach to address this relationship, and the molecular mechanisms mediating these changes. Mucosal lavages and biopsies obtained from the sigmoid and ascending colon of patients were used to assess alterations in the mucosal microbiota and the glycosylation of associated mucus in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Secondly, in vitro growth assays and gnotobiotic mouse experiments were performed to investigate the reciprocal role of mucin-degrading bacteria in the modulation of mucin O-glycosylation.
These analyses highlighted inter-patient variability, but a similar microbial composition between colonic sites. In contrast, mucin glycosylation and the expression of glycosyltransferases was regio-specific. In UC, changes in the abundances of bacterial groups, including a decrease in the A. muciniphila to R. gnavus ratio were apparent. UC mucins displayed a decrease in fucosylation, increase in sialylation, and a decrease in many complex glycan structures found in abundance in controls. In vitro growth assays suggested that UC-like mucin glycosylation impaired A. muciniphila growth, whilst R. gnavus remained unaffected, potentially explaining changes in these species in UC. Furthermore, gnotobiotic mouse experiments showed that A. muciniphila and R. gnavus were able to remodel mucin glycosylation.

In early life, the HMOS that are present in mother milk contribute to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota. Furthermore, mucins that cover the intestinal lining create a stable niche for bacterial colonization throughout a person’s life. Due to the highly complex nature of these host-secreted glycans, bacteria equipped with specific glycan-degrading enzymes can exploit them as substrate for growth. Subsequently, the glycan-degrading bacteria can drive microbial networks via cross-feeding. The glycan-foraging microbial population exerts a large influence on the host physiology, by influencing the immune, metabolic, and neurological development early in life, and by conferring colonisation resistance throughout life. The work described in this thesis aims to improve our understanding of the metabolic dependencies between the milk- and mucin-degrading microbes (Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp.) and butyrate-producing bacteria (Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). Bacteria-derived butyrate is the preferred energy source for host epithelial cells and is associated with a range of beneficial effects including enhancement of colonic barrier function, increased satiety, and protection against inflammation, and cancer. In the introductory chapter, the role of human milk and mucin glycans in fostering the gut microbial network is discussed. As such, the molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented. In Chapter 2 and 3, the role of HMOS as selective substrates for microbial growth that drive the establishment of the infant gut microbiota was investigated. At this developmental stage, HMOS promote the dominance of bifidobacteria from the Actinobacteria phylum. Upon weaning, the gut microbiota shifts towards an adult gut microbiota composition that is predominantly comprised of bacteria from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. In chapter 2, the interaction between a HMOS-degrader, Bifidobacterium infantis (Actinobacteria phylum) and a butyrogenic non-HMOS-degrader, Anaerostipes caccae (a member of the Lachnospiraceae from the Firmicutes phylum) was studied. Anaerostipes caccae in monoculture was not able to metabolise lactose or HMOS but its growth and concomitant butyrate production were detected in co-cultures with Bifidobacterium infantis. Anaerostipes caccae was sustained by cross-feeding on the monosaccharides, lactate and acetate derived from Bifidobacterium infantis. Bifidobacterium infantis fully degraded lactose and the complete range of low molecular weight HMOS, pointing towards the key ecological role of bifidobacteria in providing substrates for other important emerging species in the infant gut. The gradual shift of the microbiota composition in the ecosystem contributing to the slow induction of butyrate could also be important for gut maturation. In chapter 3, the microbial network formation in the infant gut driven by another HMOS-degrading species, namely Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was studied. We showed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could metabolise lactose and HMOS. The bacterium showed different preference for specific HMOS structures when grown in co-culture. Subsequently, Anaerostipes caccae cross-fed on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-derived monosaccharides, lactate and acetate for growth and butyrate production. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron might drive the establishment of the microbial network in the infant gut, leading to the sequential establishment of adult-like functional groups such as lactate-utilising and butyrate-producing bacteria. Furthermore, we observed stereospecific lactate isomer production in which Bacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. produced predominantly D- and L-lactate, respectively. The distinct lactate isomer production by these major glycans-degrading genera might affect the gut microbiota compositions by differential cross-feeding interaction with the lactate-utilisers. Chapter 4 and 5 studied the role of mucins in creating a micro-environment that leads to the formation of a microbial network at the intestinal mucosal layer. In chapter 4, we demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut symbiont specialised in mucin degradation, could support the growth of the butyrate-producing cross-feeders Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Akkermansia muciniphila metabolised the complex mucin glycans into short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and 1,2-propanediol as well as the mucin-derived sugars. Subsequently, acetate and the liberated sugars could be used by the butyrate-producers for growth and concomitant butyrate production. Interestingly, a bidirectional cross-feeding was observed between Akkermansia muciniphila and Eubacterium hallii. Pseudo-vitamin B12 produced by Eubacterium hallii facilitated propionate production by Akkermansia muciniphila via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Propionate could be beneficial to the human host by regulating satiety and lipid biosynthesis in the liver, indicative of a mutualistic host-microbial interaction driven by mucin glycans. In chapter 5, we studied the molecular mechanism of cross-feeding between Akkermansia muciniphila and Anaerostipes caccae by metatranscriptomics. We observed a differential transcriptional response of Akkermansia muciniphila grown in monoculture as compared to a co-culture together with Anaerostipes caccae. In particular, the expression of the extracellular mucin-degrading enzymes by Akkermansia muciniphila was heightened in co-cultures. As a result, the monosaccharides liberated from the breakdown of mucin oligosaccharides chain could support the central metabolism of both Akkermansia muciniphila and the butyrate-producer. This suggested that Akkermansia muciniphila plays a key role in supporting the microbial community at the mucosal environment of the intestine by increasing the availability of substrates. In summary, this thesis demonstrated the key functional role of milk- and mucin-degrading symbionts in fostering a butyrogenic microbial network via cross-feeding. Ecologically, HMOS-degraders are critical to drive the establishment of a healthy infant gut microbiota, whilst mucin-degraders are vital to maintain a beneficial mucosal community. A better understanding of the complex nature of both the microbial network and the host-secreted glycans could aid in the design of nutritional intervention for health improvement. To this end, innovative avenues using novel probiotic strains (key species including Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and butyrate-producing Clostridium), prebiotics (HMOS in early nutrition) and microbiota-targeted nutrients (iron and vitamin B12) deem promising.","The molecular mechanisms of glycan-foraging by key microbial species and the potential butyrate-inducing interaction among gut symbionts is presented and it is shown that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron could drive the butyrogenic trophic chain with Anaerostipes caccae."

The major component of intestinal mucus, the MUC2 mucin, is densely glycosylated, with up to 80% of its weight/volume ratio represented by O-linked glycans. Glycosylation of secretory gel-forming mucins has an enormous impact on intestinal barrier function, microbial metabolism, and mucus colonization by both pathogenic and commensal microbes. Mucin O-glycans and glycan-derived sugars may be degraded and utilized as a nutrient source, and may regulate microbial gene expression and virulence. Short chain fatty acids, produced as a by-product of glycan fermentation, can regulate host immunity and goblet cell activity, and are important for host-microbe homeostasis. Mucin glycans may also act as microbial binding sites, influencing intestinal colonization and translocation through the mucus gel barrier. Recent findings indicate that alterations to mucin glycosylation impact the susceptibility of mucins to degradation, resulting in altered barrier function and intestinal permeability. Alterations to mucin glycosylation patterns are frequently observed during intestinal infection and inflammation, and have been implicated in microbiota dysbiosis and expansion of pathobionts. Recent work has demonstrated that these alterations can play key roles in disease pathogenesis. The precise mechanisms remain obscure.

We discuss the interactions between enteric pathogens and mucins, and the mechanisms that these pathogens use to disrupt and avoid mucosal barriers. In addition, we describe dynamic alterations in the mucin barrier that are driven by host innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.","The components of the secreted and cell surface mucosal barriers and the evidence that they form an effective barricade against potential pathogens are described and dynamic alterations in the mucin barrier are described driven by host innate and adaptive immune responses to infection."

Heavily glycosylated mucin not only establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens, but also serves as a niche for microbial growth. We hypothesized that dysbiosis may cause abnormal mucin utilization and microbial metabolic dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and mucin components in the stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients from Japan. The levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in the stools of both the CD and UC patients than in those of the healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified 7 bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels, among which the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans act as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgt+Treg cells and IgA-producing cells in the colonic lamina propria. Importantly, the availability of mucin-associated O-glycans to the microbiota was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients. Taken together, our findings highlight the biological significance of the symbiosynthesis pathway in the production of n-butyrate, which maintains gut immune homeostasis.","The findings highlight the biological significance of the symbiosynthesis pathway in the production of n-butyrate, which maintains gut immune homeostasis, and the availability of mucin-associated O-glycans to the microbiota was significantly reduced in n- butyrate-deficient UC patients."

Yet the key ecological properties of mucus resident communities that make them crucial for maintaining homeostatic microbiome function remain poorly defined. Using an approach that combines in situ hybridization, laser microdissection and 16s rRNA sequencing of spatially distinct regions of the mouse gut lumen, we discovered that the microbial community embedded in the mucus layer is structurally and compositionally distinct and drives stability of the gut microbiome. Structurally, the mucus residing microbial community had a higher density of bacteria than in the lumen and formed a biofilm-like structure whose integrity was dependent on Gram-positive commensals. Compositionally the dense mucus community excluded bacteria belonging to phylum Proteobacteria. Additionally, the dense bacterial community in the mucus was significantly more diverse and consisted of bacterial species that were unique to it. Upon antibiotic treatment, the species-rich and dense bacterial community in the mucus lost fewer Firmicutes and showed smaller bloom of Proteobacteria compared to the lumen. Taken together our work discloses a crucial role for the mucus layer in promoting stability of the gut microbiome in the perfused intestinal ecosystem by spatially entrenching unique and diverse bacterial species.","A crucial role for the mucus layer is discloses in promoting stability of the gut microbiome in the perfused intestinal ecosystem by spatially entrenching unique and diverse bacterial species."

The mucus layer serves as a scaffold and a carbon source for gut microorganisms; conversely, gut microorganisms, including mucin degraders, influence mucin gene expression, glycosylation, and secretion. Conjointly they shield the epithelium from luminal pathogens, antigens, and toxins. Importantly, the mucus layer and gut microbiota are established in parallel during early postnatal life. During this period, the development of gut microbiota and mucus layer is coupled with that of the immune system. Developmental changes of different mucin types can impact the age-dependent patterns of intestinal infection in terms of incidence and severity. Altered mucus layer, dysbiotic microbiota, and abnormal mucus-gut microbiota interaction have the potential for inducing systemic effects, and accompany several intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and radiation-induced mucositis. Early life provides a pivotal window of opportunity to favorably modulate the mucus-microbiota interaction.

Derrien","","","Keywords . Mucin, A. muciniphila , mucin degradation, molecular techniques, host response Mucins are the major organic components of the defence barrier, known as mucus, covering epithelial cells in many organs, including the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microbes that can associate with mucins benefit from this interaction since they can access nutrients. Mucin-degrading bacteria are therefore an important community that have not been extensively studied as the substrate itself, mucin, is a complex and high molecular weight glycoprotein. The work presented here is focused on the identification and isolation of mucin-degrading bacteria from the GI tract, their degradation of mucin and their interaction with the host. Mucin-degrading bacteria were analysed by combining molecular- and cultivation-based approaches. The faecal mucin-degrading bacterial community was found to be highly diverse and host-specific. A novel isolate, representing a novel genus, was cultured from the highest dilution of the enrichment of a single individual. This intestinal isolate, Akkermansia muciniphila, was found to grow to a limited extent on a very limited amount of substrates but grew efficiently on mucin. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences indicated that A. muciniphila belonged to the phylum Verrucomicrobia, which was not known to contain intestinal members. Moreover, 16S rRNA genes from A. muciniphila have been retrieved in several clone libraries derived from either faecal or biopsy samples from human and mice. In addition, A. muciniphila was found to be rather abundant in the GI tract. Based on fluorescent in situ hybridisation and quantitative PCR, A. muciniphila was found to represent an average of 10 9 cells / g faecal sample. A negative correlation between the concentration of faecal mucin and the number of A. muciniphila was observed, suggesting it to be involved in mucin degradation in vivo . Several specific enzymes, mostly glycosidases were found to be secreted during its growth on mucin that was degraded for a major part (85%). Hence, the specific impact of A. muciniphila on the host was investigated in germ-free mice and compared to that of the non mucin-degrading bacterium L. plantarum . Transcriptomic microarray analysis showed that both A. muciniphila and L. plantarum modulated a similar number of genes but that host response was found to be highly specific for each bacterium, depending on the anatomical location. Amongst the major responses, we could detect for A. muciniphila a regulation of the immune response, cell proliferation, cell adhesion and apoptosis, and for L. plantarum a regulation of the lipid metabolism. Overall, this work has brought new insights into the mucin-degrading community of bacteria, and in particular the role of A. muciniphila, an abundant human mucin-degrading bacterium.","This work has brought new insights into the mucin-degrading community of bacteria, and in particular the role of A. muciniphila, an abundant human mucIn- Degrading bacterium, found to be rather abundant in the GI tract."

These glycans are further elongated with other monosaccharides and sulfate groups. Some of them could be found in dairy foods, while others are produced endogenously, in both cases interacting with the gut microbiota.

Two hundred and thirty mucin-grown colonies from the caecal contents of 7 rabbits were examined microscopically after the Gram staining. Gram-negative irregular rods were the most numerous mucinolytic isolates (34.1%), followed by gram-negative cocci and short rods (22.5%), gram-positive rods (17.3%), gram-positive cocci (16.6%) and gram-positive sporeforming rods (9.5%). An attempt was done to identify 31 typical isolates on basis of their morphology, biochemical characteristics and production of metabolites. In addition, bacterial cells were hybridized with fluorescently labelled probes for Bacteroides/Prevotella and Clostridium genus. Four isolates were identified at the species level as Mitsuokella multiacidus, three isolates as Bacteroides capillosus and one isolate as Actinomyces izraeli. All isolates except the last one belong to the Bacteroidaceae family. One strain could be assigned to the Bacteroides/Prevotella genus on basis of the hybridization test. Other mucinolytic isolates were not identified as their characteristics did not correspond to any previously described bacterial species. No Clostridium sp. strain was detected. In two M. multiacidus strains high activities of extracellular mucin lyases were found. The pH-optimum of lyases was 6.2. Calcium cations were necessary for their optimal function. This work extends general knowledge about fermentation of carbohydrate and nitrogen substrates in rabbit caecum. Rabbit, caecum, mucin, bacteria Mucin is a glycoprotein present in the mucosal layer lining mammalian gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tract. The carbohydrate moiety can be either an acidic mucopolysaccharide containing uronic acids and hexosamines or an oligosaccharide containing L-fucose and sialic acid (S alyers and Leedle 1983). Mucin composition is tissue specific and differs in different animal species. Mucin is a part of the defense mechanism as it prevents bacteria, viruses and dietary lectins from attaching to the intestinal or other epithelium. Another mucin function is the protection of the mucosal epithelium against acidic and proteolytic damage in the stomach and intestine. In the digestive tract, mucin insures a smooth passage of the foodpulp. Holmes et al.

Ndeh","","","Trillions of microorganisms inhabit mucosal surfaces of the human body. Despite increasing evidence of their impact on human health, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying hostmicrobial interactions (HMI) are poorly understood. To contribute to our understanding of HMI at mucosal surfaces, we investigated the novel family of M60-like/PF13402 domain-containing proteins and their putative functional partners. M60-like domains are shared by proteins from several mucosal microbes including two important human mucosal microbes; the bacterial mutualist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the protist pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis, suggesting these proteins are important for interaction with the mucosal layer. We initially tested our hypothesis that these are glycoprotein-targeted metal dependent proteases in both these organisms. The three M60-like domains of B. thetaiotaomicron proteins (BT4244, BT3015 and BT4272) exhibited mucin protease activity. This proteolytic activity was shown to be inhibited in a mutant version of the protein (BT4244-FL-E575D) as well as in the presence of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), implying BT4244 and its relatives are metal dependent proteases. All M60-like proteins from B. thetaiotaomicron contained a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) from family 32 and these were shown to be capable of binding galacto-configured sugars that are common to mucin glycans, while in contrast the putative carbohydrate binding PA14 domain of the T. vaginalis TVAG339720 M60-like protein interacted with heparin and its sulphated derivatives. Mucins are glycoproteins and prominent components of the mucus secreted at mucosal surfaces while heparin is a close relative of heparan sulphate which typically exists as part of proteoglycans in the glycocalyx of mucosal epithelia. Although the actual target of the M60-like domain of TVAG339720 and its relatives in T. vaginalis are not currently known, the interaction of the TVAG339720 PA14 domain with heparin suggests that these may be proteases targeting proteoglycans and play a role in adhesion of the pathogen to the epithelial layer, a key initial step in pathogenesis. M60-like domain-containing proteins of B. thetaiotaomicron are also components of Sus-like systems. Sus-like systems are Bacteroidetes specific machinery that comprise a suite of cellenvelope located carbohydrate-active enzymes and sugar binding proteins that target complex glycans, with each Sus-like system tuned to the degradation of a specific glycan. The Sus-like system containing the BT4244 enzyme (BT4240-50), encoded by the polysaccharide locus (PUL) PULBT_4240-50 was characterised in this study. The results demonstrated that BT4244 is a surface protein and that its proteolytic activity is part of a concerted action of BT4240-50 components to utilise complex mucin glycoproteins containing the T (Galβ1-3GalNAc) and F (GalNAcα1-3GalNAc) antigens. Gene deletion studies revealed that PULBT_4240-50 provides a competitive advantage to the organism when grown on mucins, probably through its possession of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) kinase BT4240, which was shown to be crucial for GalNAc utilisation. Finally, although variably conserved in closely related Bacteroides, the high frequency of PULBT_4240-50 components in this group of organisms suggests it may be an important evolutionary adaptation for survival at mucosal surfaces. Our findings not only set the stage for future functional studies on the novel M60-like/PF13402 family of proteins and their functional partners, but also further our understanding of host-microbial interactions at mucosal surfaces.","The results demonstrated that BT4244 is a surface protein and that its proteolytic activity is part of a concerted action of BT4240-50 components to utilise complex mucin glycoproteins containing the T (Galβ1-3 GalNAc) and F (GalNAcα 1-3GalNAC) antigens."

Commensals that compete with pathogens for such nutrients are therefore ecological gatekeepers in healthy guts, and are attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there is a poor understanding of which commensals use mucin-derived sugars in situ as well as their potential to impede pathogen colonization. Here, we identify mouse gut commensals that utilize mucus-derived monosaccharides within complex communities using single-cell stable isotope probing, Raman-activated cell sorting and mini-metagenomics.

A systematic view can help better understand the etiology of some complex disorders such as cystic fibrosis, ulcerative colitis and expand our knowledge about mucin degraders to develop new therapeutic approaches to correct ill effects caused by these mucin-dwelling pathogens.","In this article, the role played by the bacterial species directly or indirectly involved in mucin degradation, alteration in mucus secretion or its composition or mucin gene expression, which instigates many diseases in the digestive, respiratory and other organ systems."

Even with some Bacteroides species being categorized as pathogens, Bacteroides is one of the most dominant gut bacteria. Here we indicate the physiological determinants of the species of Bacteroides for being dominant in human gut microbiota. Each of the host extracellular mucosubstances including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and mucin has grown human gut microbiota. In spite of the differences among initial microbiota profiles, Bacteroides species dominated the community when GAG (e.g., chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronan) was used as a sole carbon source. In fact, GAGs and the Bacteroides genes which are vital for the degradation of GAGs were commonly detected in human feces. Mucin has encouraged the growth of Bacteroides and several other genera. A comprehensive analysis on the degradation and assimilation of mucosubstances by the genus Bacteroides using around 30 species has shown that most species degrade and assimilate GAGs and mucin, showing that Bacteroides species can survive even in the undernutrition condition including the fasting state. In the assimilation of GAG or mucin, Bacteroides species significantly secreted essential amino acids, γ-amino butyrate (GABA), and/or short-chain fatty acids which are needed for human health. This is the first report as regards mutually beneficial interaction between human and Bacteroides species via bacterial assimilation of host mucosubstances and secretion of metabolites for host health promotion. Significance The genus Bacteroides is one of the most dominant gut bacteria, although its beneficial effects on human health have not been well understood. Here, we show modes of action in human-Bacteroides interrelationship. Mucosubstances including GAGs and mucin secreted by human host are abundant in gut for microbiota to grow well. Bacteroides species are dominant in the community in the presence of GAGs, and provide human host with a considerable amount of essential amino acids, γ-amino butyrate, and short-chain fatty acids produced from mucosubstances. These results postulate mutually beneficial symbiosis system between human and Bacteroides through bacterial assimilation of host mucosubstances and secretion of metabolites for human body and mental health promotion even in the undernutrition condition including the fasting state.","Bacteroides species are dominant in the community in the presence of GAGs, and provide human host with a considerable amount of essential amino acids, γ-amino butyrate, and short-chain fatty acids produced from mucosubstances, which are needed for human health."

Mucin glycan utilization requires the removal of diverse protective caps, notably, fucose and sialic acid, but the enzymatic details of this process remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the specificities of ten A. muciniphila glycoside hydrolases, which collectively remove all known sialyl and fucosyl mucin caps including those with double sulphated epitopes. Structural analyses revealed an unprecedented fucosidase modular arrangement and explained the exclusive sialyl T-antigen specificity of a sialidase of a previously unknown family and catalytic apparatus. Key cell attached sialidases and fucosidases conferred mucin-binding and their inhibition abolished growth of A. muciniphila on mucin. Remarkably, the sialic acid fucose did not contribute to A. muciniphila growth, but instead promoted butyrate production by co-cultured Clostridia. This study brings unique mechanistic insight into the initiation of mucin O -glycan degradation by A. muciniphila and the nutrient sharing between key mucus-associated bacteria.

However, our knowledge about mucin type O-glycan degradation by bifidobacteria remains fragmentary, especially regarding how they decompose sulfated glycans, which are abundantly found in mucin sugar-chains. Here, we examined the abilities of several Bifidobacterium strains to degrade a sulfated glycan substrate and identified a 6-sulfo-β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase, also termed sulfoglycosidase, encoded by bbhII from Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM 7004.

The purified BbhII directly released 6-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine from porcine gastric mucin and the expression of bbhII was moderately induced in the presence of mucin.

Udo Schumacher","","","UNLABELLED The understanding of mechanisms responsible for alterations in mucin synthesis and secretions is essential in elucidating the aetiology of intestinal disorders. The existence of distinct mucins and M-cell transport mechanisms, and their beneficial effects, have long been recognised. Since nutritional and bacterial factors alter the mucin characteristics and are relevant to planning preventative strategies for intestinal diseases, the studies described in this monograph were designed to test the hypothesis that mucin composition and endocrine status of the intestinal tract are altered by dietary constituents and microbial flora. A study of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) was undertaken to test the hypothesis that lymphocyte-epithelial interactions influence the glycosylation of cells overlying Peyer's patches. The effects of diet and microbial flora were analysed by comparing the data from male Wistar germ-free rats, with conventional or human flora. Such rats were fed either a commercial diet, containing crude fibre, or a purified diet. Bone marrow transfers from syngeneic Balb/c mice to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were made to induce the formation of GALT. A comparison was made of the glycoconjugate profile of Peyer's patches in the guts of mice and humans. The results of the study showed that feeding a fibre-rich diet to germ-free rats resulted in increased villus-crypt lengths, decreased carboxylated mucin content of goblet cells, increased N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues in the surface goblet cells, and a reduction in the number of endocrine cells in the small intestine. The lectin markers revealed M-cell development in the dome epithelium of the reconstituted SCID mice. Mouse M cells were labelled by fucose-specific lectins but in human Peyer's patches no distinct M-cell-staining pattern was observed. CONCLUSIONS (1) the interactions between diet and flora alter the mucosal architecture and the activity of endocrine cells; (2) the dietary changes are influential in modifying the epithelial mucin predominantly in the small intestine while the microbial flora influences the mucosal architecture predominantly in the large intestine; (3) the use of bone marrow transplantation from syngeneic mice into SCID mice along with lectin markers for M cells can be used to study the histogenesis of Peyer's patches; (4) the distinct differences between mouse and human Peyer's patches suggest that when considering cell surface glycoconjugates as target molecules appropriate lectin should be used for each species. A future challenge in intestinal epithelial cell biology is identifying the nature and distribution of cell surface receptors for specific dietary components and bacteria.","The hypothesis that mucin composition and endocrine status of the intestinal tract are altered by dietary constituents and microbial flora is tested and the distinct differences between mouse and human Peyer's patches suggest that when considering cell surface glycoconjugates as target molecules appropriate lectin should be used for each species."
