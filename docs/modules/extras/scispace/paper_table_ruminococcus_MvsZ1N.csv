We have tested the activities and substrate specificities of these enzymes using para-nitrophenyl glycosides and glycosphingolipids of different core chains (lacto, neolacto, globo, isoglobo, galabio, and ganglio), carrying different blood group determinants (A, H, X, Y, Forssman, and para-Forssman), and with different degrees of sialylation (mono- to tetra-sialo). Lactotetraosylceramide and neolactotetraosylceramide were the only core glycosphingolipids degraded by enzymes from these strains, resulting in lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide as the major end products. R. gnavus strain VI-268 did not degrade lactotetraosylceramide but only neolactotetraosylceramide yielding lactotriaosylceramide and lactosylceramide as the major end products. All strains but R. gnavus VI-268 also produced lactosylceramide from a bi-antennary 10-sugar glycosphingolipid with two blood group H determinants based on a lactotetraosylceramide core. Apart from strain specific blood group A-degrading (R. torques strain VIII-239 and IX-70, R. gnavus strain VI-268 and B. infantis VIII-240) and Forssman-degrading (R. torques VIII-239 and IX-70) activities, all strains also degraded the H-5, X-5, and Y-6 glycosphingolipids. All strains released N-acetylneuraminic acid from the gangliosides sialosyl-neolactotetraosylceramide, GD3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b corresponding to 2,3-alpha- and 2,8-alpha-N-acetylneuraminidase activities. The R. torques strains VIII-239 and IX-70 also partially desialylated GM1 to lactotetraosylceramide. The para-nitrophenyl glycoside degradations were often incompatible with the data from the glycosphingolipids degradations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Five strains of human fecal bacteria produce extracellular alpha- and beta-glycosidases that degrade intestinal mucin oligosaccharides and glycosphingolipids of the lacto-series type 1 chain, and the activities and substrate specificities of these enzymes were tested using para-nitrophenyl glycosides and Glycosides of different core chains."

George L. Mendz","10.1099/JMM.0.47752-0","","Campylobacter jejuni is the main cause of bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide. In its colonization of the host intestinal tract, it encounters secreted mucins in the mucus layer and surface mucins in the epithelial cells. Mucins are complex glycoproteins that comprise the major component of mucus and give mucus its viscous consistency. MUC2 is the most abundant secreted mucin in the human intestine; it is a major chemoattractant for C. jejuni, and the bacterium binds to it. There are no studies on the transcriptional response of the bacterium to this mucin. Here, cell-culture techniques and quantitative RT-PCR were used to characterize in vitro the effects of MUC2 on C. jejuni growth and the changes in expression of 20 C. jejuni genes related to various functions. The genes encoding cytolethal distending toxin protein (cdtABC), vacuolating cytotoxin (vacB), C. jejuni lipoprotein (jlpA), Campylobacter invasion antigen (ciaB), the multidrug efflux system (cmeAB), putative mucin-degrading enzymes (cj1344c, cj0843c, cj0256 and cj1055c), flagellin A (flaA) and putative rod-shape-determining proteins (mreB and mreC) were upregulated, whereas those encoding Campylobacter adhesion fibronectin-binding protein (cadF) and sialic acid synthase (neuB1) were downregulated. These results showed that C. jejuni utilizes MUC2 as an environmental cue for the modulation of expression of genes with various functions including colonization and pathogenicity.","Results showed that C. jejuni utilizes MUC2 as an environmental cue for the modulation of expression of genes with various functions including colonization and pathogenicity."

The mucin MUC5B is a complex oligomeric glycoprotein, heterogeneous in molecular mass (14–40×106 Da), with a diverse repertoire of oligosaccharides, differing in composition and charge. The aim of this study was to investigate whether proteolytic degradation of the mucin polypeptide backbone could be identified and if cooperation of dental biofilm bacteria was required. Cooperative bacteria-mediated proteolysis of MUC5B was determined by comparing individual species and mixed consortia of strains isolated from supragingival plaque, and freshly harvested supragingival plaque. Proteolytic activity was analysed using fluorescent labelled substrate and by visualizing mucin degradation by SDS-PAGE. Dental plaque degraded the polypeptide backbone of the salivary MUC5B mucin. The mucin was also degraded by a specific consortium of isolated species from supragingival plaque, although individual species and other consortia did not. Certain bacteria in supragingival dental plaque therefore cooperate as a consortium to proteolyse human salivary MUC5B and hydrolyse glycosides.","Investigating whether proteolytic degradation of the mucin polypeptide backbone could be identified and if cooperation of dental biofilm bacteria was required found it necessary to proteolyse human salivary MUC5B and hydrolyse glycosides found it to be necessary."

A possible role for faecal mucin sulphatase in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has therefore been explored. Faecal mucin sulphatase activity assayed using 35S mucin as substrate was increased in ulcerative colitis (median 80.2 units/g pellet weight (range 6.9-1063; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 45.2 to 293.8, n = 22) compared with 11.3 units/g (range 3.0-53.5; 95% CI: 8.7 to 29.8, n = 17) in healthy controls (p < 0.01), where one unit released 1000 dpm free sulphate/hour from 35S mucin (1680 dpm/microgram). Patients with active ulcerative colitis had higher sulphatase activity (median 146; 95% CI: 98 to 253 units/g, n = 10) than those with inactive ulcerative colitis (median 42.2; CI: 22.5 to 81.6 units/g, n = 12) (p < 0.05). Longitudinal studies in patients with ulcerative colitis show fluctuations of faecal mucin sulphatase activity corresponding to clinical disease activity in six of seven patients. Faecal mucin sulphatase activity was not significantly increased in Crohn's disease (median 36.6, range 5.7-106.6; 95% CI: 22.9 to 65.3 units/g, n = 14). The bismuth salts, bismuth subcitrate and bismuth subsalicylate were found to inhibit faecal mucin sulphatase activity at concentrations achievable therapeutically. The increased faecal mucin sulphatase activity in ulcerative colitis could be the result of greater intraluminal substrate (mucin) availability leading to bacterial enzyme induction, but would probably result in more rapid degradation of secreted mucin and represents a potential target for treatment.","The increased faecal mucin sulphatase activity in ulcerative colitis could be the result of greater intraluminal substrate (mucin) availability leading to bacterial enzyme induction, but would probably result in more rapid degradation of secreted mucin and represents a potential target for treatment."

The gel-forming component of mucus is mucin, a large polymeric glycoprotein. The present study examined the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica (with and without its virulence plasmid) in purified rabbit small intestinal mucin and the ability of bacteria to degrade mucin. Both virulent and nonvirulent organisms showed enhanced growth in mucin-supplemented media compared with unsupplemented media, but only at 37 degrees C and not at 25 degrees C. The effects of mucin were not specific because medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin also enhanced bacterial growth at 37 degrees C. Purified mucin was broken down into lower-molecular-weight components (assessed by monitoring its elution profile on a Sepharose CL-2B column) by plasmid-bearing Y. enterocolitica but not by plasmid-cured organisms. Culturing virulent Y. enterocolitica at 25 degrees C completely suppressed its capacity to degrade mucin, suggesting that this activity depends on plasmid expression. These results were confirmed in similar studies with purified rabbit colonic mucin. Mucin-degrading activity could be demonstrated in spent culture media from virulent Y. enterocolitica incubated at 37 degrees C but not in bacterial membrane preparations. Changes in the elution profiles of small intestinal and colonic mucins exposed to plasmid-bearing Y. enterocolitica at 37 degrees C were consistent with proteolytic depolymerization. The ability to grow well in mucin may help Y. enterocolitica to colonize the intestine, while the production of a mucin-degrading enzyme(s) by plasmid-bearing organisms may assist pathogenic strains to solubilize and penetrate the mucus gel layer.","The ability to grow well in mucin may help Y. enterocolitica to colonize the intestine, while the production of a mucin-degrading enzyme(s) by plasmid-bearing organisms may assist pathogenic strains to solubilize and penetrate the mucus gel layer."

In this study we have used digoxigenin-labelled lectins of various specificities to monitor changes in the nonreducing end groups of oligosaccharide chains following their degradation by Streptococcus oralis Ny 586 and Streptococcus sanguis Ny 584. The reaction of degraded mucin with peanut lectin, that recognizes the core disaccharide Gal (1,3)GalNAc in O-glycans, revealed a more extensive degradation of oligosaccharide by S. oralis than by S. sanguis. This corresponds to better growth of S. oralis on the mucin. Analyses with Datura stramonium lectin showed that terminal Gal (1,4)GlcNAc, or GlcNAc (1,4)GlcNAc moieties, in the oligosaccharides are attacked by both strains. Reaction patterns with α-L-fucose-specific lectins indicated that terminal fucose was released by S. oralis but not by S. sanguis. This was in accordance with sugar analyses which showed that approximately 40% of the fucose units were released. The results extend previously observed losses of sugars from oligosaccharide chains during growth of these organisms on mucin.","Digoxigenin-labelled lectins of various specificities are used to monitor changes in the nonreducing end groups of oligosaccharide chains following their degradation by Streptococcus oralis and S. sanguis."

Udo Schumacher","","","UNLABELLED The understanding of mechanisms responsible for alterations in mucin synthesis and secretions is essential in elucidating the aetiology of intestinal disorders. The existence of distinct mucins and M-cell transport mechanisms, and their beneficial effects, have long been recognised. Since nutritional and bacterial factors alter the mucin characteristics and are relevant to planning preventative strategies for intestinal diseases, the studies described in this monograph were designed to test the hypothesis that mucin composition and endocrine status of the intestinal tract are altered by dietary constituents and microbial flora. A study of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) was undertaken to test the hypothesis that lymphocyte-epithelial interactions influence the glycosylation of cells overlying Peyer's patches. The effects of diet and microbial flora were analysed by comparing the data from male Wistar germ-free rats, with conventional or human flora. Such rats were fed either a commercial diet, containing crude fibre, or a purified diet. Bone marrow transfers from syngeneic Balb/c mice to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were made to induce the formation of GALT. A comparison was made of the glycoconjugate profile of Peyer's patches in the guts of mice and humans. The results of the study showed that feeding a fibre-rich diet to germ-free rats resulted in increased villus-crypt lengths, decreased carboxylated mucin content of goblet cells, increased N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid residues in the surface goblet cells, and a reduction in the number of endocrine cells in the small intestine. The lectin markers revealed M-cell development in the dome epithelium of the reconstituted SCID mice. Mouse M cells were labelled by fucose-specific lectins but in human Peyer's patches no distinct M-cell-staining pattern was observed. CONCLUSIONS (1) the interactions between diet and flora alter the mucosal architecture and the activity of endocrine cells; (2) the dietary changes are influential in modifying the epithelial mucin predominantly in the small intestine while the microbial flora influences the mucosal architecture predominantly in the large intestine; (3) the use of bone marrow transplantation from syngeneic mice into SCID mice along with lectin markers for M cells can be used to study the histogenesis of Peyer's patches; (4) the distinct differences between mouse and human Peyer's patches suggest that when considering cell surface glycoconjugates as target molecules appropriate lectin should be used for each species. A future challenge in intestinal epithelial cell biology is identifying the nature and distribution of cell surface receptors for specific dietary components and bacteria.","The hypothesis that mucin composition and endocrine status of the intestinal tract are altered by dietary constituents and microbial flora is tested and the distinct differences between mouse and human Peyer's patches suggest that when considering cell surface glycoconjugates as target molecules appropriate lectin should be used for each species."

The relation between mucin and commensal bacteria was assessed to determine whether commensals possess mucinolytic activity, how degradation depends on mucin integrity, and whether mucins affect bacterial replication. Methods: Bacteria were sampled from healthy eyes and contact lenses from asymptomatic wearers. Intracellular mucins were extracted and purified from cadaver conjunctivas, and surface mucins from extended wear contact lenses. After exposure to bacteria, changes in mucin hydrodynamic volume (proteolytic cleavage) and subunit charge (oligosaccharide degradation) were assayed by size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography. The effect of mucin on bacterial replication was followed for up to 24 hours from the end of incubation with purified ocular mucins. Results: Ocular bacteria decreased the hydrodynamic volume of intracellular and contact lens adherent mucins, irrespective of glycosylation density. A decrease in mucin sialylation was observed after exposure to commensal bacteria. Subunit charge distributions were generally shifted to lesser negative charge, consistent with loss of charged epitopes. Subunits with high negative charge, observed after digesting lightly adhering contact lens mucins with bacteria, suggest preferential cleavage sites in the mucin molecule. The presence of purified ocular mucin in the medium inhibited bacterial growth. Conclusion: Bacteria in the healthy ocular surface possess mucinolytic activity on both intact and surface processed mucins, targeted to discrete sites in the mucin molecule.

This raises the possibility that probiotics may play an active role in enhancing the intestinal barrier at the mucosal surface. In this study, we investigated whether the clinically tested VSL#3 probiotic formula and/or its secreted components can augment the protective mucus layer in vivo and in vitro. For in vivo studies, Wistar rats were orally administered the probiotic mixture VSL#3 on a daily basis for seven days. After treatment, basal luminal mucin content increased by 60%. In addition, we exposed isolated rat colonic loops to the VSL#3 probiotic formula, which significantly stimulated colonic mucin (MUC) secretion and MUC2 gene expression; however, MUC1 and MUC3 gene expression were only slightly elevated. The effect of the VSL#3 mucin secretagogue was also tested in vitro by use of LS 174T colonic epithelial cells. In contrast to the animal studies, cultured cells incubated with VSL#3 bacteria did not exhibit increased mucin secretion. However, the bacterial secreted products contained in the conditioned media stimulated a remarkable mucin secretion effect. Among the three bacterial groups (Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococci) contained in VSL#3, the Lactobacillus species were the strongest potentiator of mucin secretion in vitro. A preliminary characterization of the putative mucin secretagogue suggested that it was a heat-resistant soluble compound, which is not sensitive to protease and DNase treatment. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex and beneficial interaction between colonic epithelial cells and intestinal bacteria.","Among the three bacterial groups contained in VSL#3, the Lactobacillus species were the strongest potentiator of mucin secretion in vitro, and this findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex and beneficial interaction between colonic epithelial cells and intestinal bacteria."

Pathogenic V. cholerae strains are characterized by the presence of a Vibrio pathogenicity island (VPI) that encodes virulence factors, including the toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP). TagA is encoded within the VPI and is positively co-regulated with cholera toxin and TCP. TagA is a sequelogue of the StcE mucinase of Escherichia coli O157 : H7. We investigated whether this sequence homology reflected a conserved enzymic substrate profile. TagA exhibited metalloprotease activity toward crude purified mucins, salivary mucin and LS174T goblet cell surface mucin. Like StcE, TagA did not cleave general protease substrates, but unlike StcE, TagA did not cleave the mucin-like serpin C1 esterase inhibitor. Both proteins cleaved the immune cell surface mucin CD43, but TagA demonstrated reduced enzymic efficiency relative to StcE. TagA was expressed and secreted by V. cholerae under ToxR-dependent conditions.

Mutation of either gene significantly reduced enzymatic activity, but beta-galactosidase activity in the double mutant, although significantly less than that in either of the single mutants, was not completely abolished. The expression of SPD_0065 in S. pneumoniae grown in mucin-containing medium or tissues harvested from infected animals was significantly upregulated compared to that in pneumococci from glucose-containing medium. The SPD_0065 mutant strain was found to be attenuated in virulence in a manner specific to the host tissue.","The SPD_0065 mutant strain was found to be attenuated in virulence in a manner specific to the host tissue, and β-galactosidase activity in the double mutant, although significantly less than that in either of the single mutants, was not completely abolished."

Hap has been shown to have mucinolytic and cytotoxic activity. These activities are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cholera and the reactogenicity of attenuated vaccine strains. Production of Hap requires transcriptional activation by the HapR regulator and is repressed by glucose. The present study shows that mucin purified from two sources, bile salts, and growth at 37 ˚ C enhanced Hap protease production. Analysis of hapA and hapR promoter fusions with the lacZ gene showed both promoters to be activated in a cell-density-dependent pattern. Glucose repressed and mucin induced the hapA promoter by a HapR-independent mechanism. Bile had no effect on either hapR or hapA promoter activity. Expression of hapA was required for vibrios to translocate through a mucin-containing gel. These results suggest Hap to play an important role in cholera pathogenesis by promoting mucin gel penetration, detachment and spreading of infection along the gastrointestinal tract.","The present study shows that mucin purified from two sources, bile salts, and growth at 37 degrees C enhanced Hap protease production, suggesting Hap to play an important role in cholera pathogenesis by promoting mucin gel penetration, detachment and spreading of infection along the gastrointestinal tract."
