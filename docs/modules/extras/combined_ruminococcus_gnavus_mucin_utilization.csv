The species Ruminococcus gnavus is present in the digestive tract of ≥90% of humans and has been implicated in gut-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Here we analysed the ability of two R. gnavus human strains, E1 and ATCC 29149, to utilize host glycans. We showed that although both strains could assimilate mucin monosaccharides, only R. gnavus ATCC 29149 was able to grow on mucin as a sole carbon source. Comparative genomic analysis of the two R. gnavus strains highlighted potential clusters and glycoside hydrolases (GHs) responsible for the breakdown and utilization of mucin-derived glycans. Transcriptomic and functional activity assays confirmed the importance of specific GH33 sialidase, and GH29 and GH95 fucosidases in the mucin utilisation pathway. Notably, we uncovered a novel pathway by which R. gnavus ATCC 29149 utilises sialic acid from sialylated substrates. Our results also demonstrated the ability of R. gnavus ATCC 29149 to produce propanol and propionate as the end products of metabolism when grown on mucin and fucosylated glycans. These new findings provide molecular insights into the strain-specificity of R. gnavus adaptation to the gut environment advancing our understanding of the role of gut commensals in health and disease."

Here, we focused on two major human gut symbionts, the mucin-degrader Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149, and R. bromii L2-63, a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch (RS) in human colon. Using anaerobic individual and co-cultures of R. bromii and R. gnavus grown on mucin or starch as sole carbon source, we showed that starch degradation by R. bromii supported the growth of R. gnavus whereas R. bromii did not benefit from mucin degradation by R. gnavus. Further we analyzed the growth (quantitative PCR), metabolite production (1H NMR analysis), and bacterial transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) of R. bromii cultured with RS or soluble starch (SS) in the presence or absence of R. gnavus. In co-culture fermentations on starch, 1H NMR analysis showed that R. gnavus benefits from transient glucose and malto-oligosaccharides released by R. bromii upon starch degradation, producing acetate, formate, and lactate as main fermentation end-products. Differential expression analysis (DESeq 2) on starch (SS and RS) showed that the presence of R. bromii induced changes in R. gnavus transcriptional response of genes encoding several maltose transporters and enzymes involved in its metabolism such as maltose phosphorylase, in line with the ability of R. gnavus to utilize R. bromii starch degradation products. In the RS co-culture, R. bromii showed a significant increase in the induction of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes and a decrease of vitamin B12 (VitB12)-dependent methionine biosynthesis as compared to the mono-culture, suggesting that Trp and VitB12 availability become limited in the presence of R. gnavus. Together this study showed a direct competition between R. bromii and R. gnavus on RS, suggesting that in vivo, the R. gnavus population inhabiting the mucus niche may be modulated by the supply of non-digestible carbohydrates reaching the colon such as RS."

R. gnavus is part of the healthy gut microbiota in humans, but it is disproportionately represented in diseases. There is therefore a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin the adaptation of R. gnavus to the gut. Previous in vitro research has demonstrated that the mucin-glycan-foraging strategy of R. gnavus is strain dependent and is associated with the expression of an intramolecular trans-sialidase, which releases 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac, rather than Neu5Ac, from mucins. Here, we unravelled the metabolism pathway of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac in R. gnavus that is underpinned by the exquisite specificity of the sialic transporter for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and by the action of an oxidoreductase that converts 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac into Neu5Ac, which then becomes a substrate of a Neu5Ac-specific aldolase. Having generated an R. gnavus nan-cluster deletion mutant that lost the ability to grow on sialylated substrates, we showed that-in gnotobiotic mice colonized with R. gnavus wild-type (WT) and mutant strains-the fitness of the nan mutant was significantly impaired, with a reduced ability to colonize the mucus layer. Overall, we revealed a unique sialic acid pathway in bacteria that has important implications for the spatial adaptation of mucin-foraging gut symbionts in health and disease."

However, MD bacterial physiology and metabolism remain elusive. Here, we assessed functional modules of mucin catabolism, through a comprehensive bioinformatics-aided functional annotation, to identify 54 A. muciniphila genes and 296 R. gnavus genes. The reconstructed core metabolic pathways coincided with the growth kinetics and fermentation profiles of A. muciniphila and R. gnavus grown in the presence of mucin and its constituents. Genome-wide multi-omics analyses validated the nutrient-dependent fermentation profiles of the MD bacteria and identified their distinct mucolytic enzymes. The distinct metabolic features of the two MD bacteria induced differences in the metabolite receptor levels and inflammatory signals of the host immune cells. In addition, in vivo experiments and community-scale metabolic modeling demonstrated that different dietary intakes influenced the abundance of MD bacteria, their metabolic fluxes, and gut barrier integrity. Thus, this study provides insights into how diet-induced metabolic differences in MD bacteria determine their distinct physiological roles in the host immune response and the gut ecosystem."

Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from R. gnavus ATCC 29149, RgGH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that RgGH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed RgGH98 affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of RgGH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of RgGH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of RgGH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that RgGH98 is part of an operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when R. gnavus ATCC 29149 is grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed RgGH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that RgGH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with RgGH98 confered R. gnavus E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data further support that the GH repertoire of R. gnavus strains enable them to colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection."

In this work we have obtained and analyzed the draft genome sequence of another R. gnavus mucin-degrader, ATCC 35913, isolated from a healthy individual. Transcriptomics analyses of both ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 strains confirmed that the strategy utilized by R. gnavus for mucin-degradation is focused on the utilization of terminal mucin glycans. R. gnavus ATCC 35913 also encodes a predicted IT-sialidase and harbors a Nan cluster dedicated to sialic acid utilization. We showed that the Nan cluster was upregulated when the strains were grown in presence of mucin. In addition we demonstrated that both R. gnavus strains were able to grow on 2,7-anyhydro-Neu5Ac, the IT-sialidase transglycosylation product, as a sole carbon source. Taken together these data further support the hypothesis that IT-sialidase expressing gut microbes, provide commensal bacteria such as R. gnavus with a nutritional competitive advantage, by accessing and transforming a source of nutrient to their own benefit."

With the advent of metagenomics, R. gnavus has been associated both positively and negatively with an increasing number of intestinal and extraintestinal diseases from inflammatory bowel diseases to neurological disorders. This prompted renewed interest in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of R. gnavus to the gut, and the molecular mediators affecting its association with health and disease. From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the biological characterization of R. gnavus, its occurrence in the infant and adult gut microbiota and the factors influencing its colonization of the gastrointestinal tract; we also discuss the current state of our knowledge on its role in host health and disease. We highlight gaps in knowledge and discuss the hypothesis that differential health outcomes associated with R. gnavus in the gut are strain and niche specific."

- **Reasoning:** Shows robust controls and replication for sialic‑acid growth assays; investigates mucin‑derived sugar utilization but not mucin itself, offering partial metabolic insight without direct mucin growth data.","Ruminococcus gnavus is a prevalent human gut commensal bacterium with known roles in intestinal mucus degradation, including by catabolism of the terminal mucin sugar sialic acid. While R. gnavus is not considered a pathogen, overabundance of this species is correlated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its sialic acid metabolism may play a role in the dysbiotic state. Interestingly, liberation of mucin-bound sialic acid by R. gnavus yields the distinct product of 2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), in contrast to other known mucin-degrading bacteria, which generate Neu5Ac. This prompted us to look for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism proteins in the genomes of 77 R. gnavus clinical isolates. We found that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism is sporadically distributed in this species with respect to phylogeny and strain origin. We measured sialic acid-dependent growth of 12 sequenced isolates, finding that the presence of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism proteins was predictive of growth on this substrate. Our analysis also uncovered ""partial"" 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism pathways in two R. gnavus strains, leading to the discovery that these strains grow with Neu5Ac as a sole carbon source, a metabolic capability previously unreported in this species. These results reveal a notable diversity of sialic acid catabolism across the R. gnavus species, an essential consideration for further investigations into the importance of this metabolism in mucin degradation and in the roles of R. gnavus in IBD and other gut dysbioses. Ruminococcus gnavus is a common resident of the human gut, but often blooms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It remains unclear whether R. gnavus plays any direct role in disease occurrence. This study investigates R. gnavus utilization of sialic acid, a crucial component of host mucins, the main constituents of the mucus that lines and protects the gut. We profile variations in sialic acid metabolic pathways and growth among 77 R. gnavus strains, isolated from healthy people and individuals with IBD, discovering further diversity in sialic acid utilization than was previously appreciated. This study emphasizes that the intricate interaction between bacteria and their environment must be examined at the strain level to understand the roles of particular species in health and disease. "

Binding capacity is often the main criterion used to investigate the probiotic characteristics of bacteria. In this study, we focused on a collection of 163 Lactobacillaceace comprising 156 bacteria isolated from traditional amylaceous fermented foods and seven strains taken from a collection and used as controls. The collection had a series of analyses to assess binding potential for the selection of new probiotic candidates. The presence/absence of 14 genes involved in binding to the gastrointestinal tract was assessed. This enabled the detection of all the housekeeping genes (ef-Tu, eno, gap, groEl and srtA) in the entire collection, of some of the other genes (apf, cnb, fpbA, mapA, mub) in 86% to 100% of LAB, and of the other genes (cbsA, gtf, msa, slpA) in 0% to 8% of LAB. Most of the bacteria isolated from traditional fermented foods exhibited a genetic profile favorable for their binding to the gastrointestinal tract. We selected 30 strains with different genetic profiles to test their binding ability to non-mucus (HT29) and mucus secreting (HT29-MTX) cell lines as well as their ability to degrade mucus. Assays on both lines revealed high variability in binding properties among the LAB, depending on the cell model used. Finally, we investigated if their binding ability was linked to tighter cross-talk between bacteria and eukaryotic cells by measuring the expression of bacterial genes and of the eukaryotic MUC2 gene. Results showed that wild LAB from tropical amylaceous fermented food had a much higher binding capacity than the two LAB currently known to be probiotics. However their adhesion was not linked to any particular genetic equipment."

We established a link between Rg and ileal CD AIEC strain LF82 by showing that dual colonization of ex-germ-free (GF) IL10-/- mice potentiated colitis and cecal H2S production. Rg precultured mucus increased LF82 growth and H2S production, H2S supported in vitro Rg survival in minimal medium, and H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo (DDW 2023). Rg’s capsule contains glucose and has an enzyme that cleaves off sialic acid (Neu5Ac), one of the terminal carbohydrates of mucus. Because inflamed colons become microaerophilic to some extent, we focused on Rg-derived glucose and mucus-derived Neu5Ac to explore expression of LF82 molecular pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. HYPOTHESIS AIEC LF82 genes regulating growth, H2S production and virulence are differentially expressed with glucose or Neu5Ac substrates in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions. METHODS LF82 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with Rg-/mucus-derived carbohydrates or gut-relevant sulfur substrates for 16 hours in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. LF82 RNA cultured with glucose or Neu5Ac medium in each condition was isolated for RNA sequencing. We compared aerobic vs. anaerobic results for each medium with |Log2FC| &amp;gt; 3.0 considered significant change. RESULTS Rg associated mucus carbohydrates and gut-relevant sulfur substrates variably enhanced LF82 growth. LF82 grew better in Neu5Ac than glucose in aerobic and vice versa in anaerobic conditions (Fig.1). Neu5Ac metabolism pathways involving nanE (N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase) and dnaA (chromosomal replication initiator), directly involved in cell replication, were overexpressed in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions in Neu5Ac medium. Additionally, expression of other Neu5Ac metabolic pathway genes, nanT (sialic transporter) and nanA (N-acetylneuraminate lyase) were slightly increased. Porin OmpC, a non-specific glucose transporter, and dnaA were more highly expressed in anaerobic than aerobic conditions in glucose medium (Table 1A). Moreover, LF82 genes involved in H2S production, biofilm formation and antimicrobial drug resistance were overexpressed in glucose vs. Neu5Ac with aerobic culture (Table 1B). CONCLUSIONS AIEC LF82 differentially uses R. gnavus released mucus components for growth in aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions, and sialic acid and glucose activate distinct molecular pathways in the two conditions. Confirmatory functional experiments are underway. Glucose influences on LF82 H2S production and biofilm formation would provide strong evidence of cross-feeding between LF82 and R. gnavus, leading to potential diagnostic/treatment clues for further investigation.

To access this source of nutrients, gut bacteria encode α-L-fucosidases (fucosidases) which catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal α-L-fucosidic linkages. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of fucosidases from the human gut symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus. Sequence similarity network identified strain-specific fucosidases in R. gnavus ATCC 29149 and E1 strains that were further validated enzymatically against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. Using a combination of glycan microarrays, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, crystallographic and saturation transfer difference NMR approaches, we identified a fucosidase with the capacity to recognize sialic acid-terminated fucosylated glycans (sialyl Lewis X/A epitopes) and hydrolyze α1-3/4 fucosyl linkages in these substrates without the need to remove sialic acid. Molecular dynamics simulation and docking showed that 3'-Sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) could be accommodated within the binding site of the enzyme. This specificity may contribute to the adaptation of R. gnavus strains to the infant and adult gut and has potential applications in diagnostic glycomic assays for diabetes and certain cancers."

While R. gnavus is not considered a pathogen, overabundance of this species is correlated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), and its sialic acid metabolism may play a role in the dysbiotic state. Interestingly, liberation of mucin-bound sialic acid by R. gnavus yields the distinct product of 2,7-anhydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac), in contrast to other known mucin-degrading bacteria, which generate Neu5Ac. This prompted us to look for 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism proteins in the genomes of 77 R. gnavus clinical isolates. We found that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac metabolism is sporadically distributed in this species with respect to phylogeny and strain origin. We measured sialic acid-dependent growth of 12 sequenced isolates, finding that the presence of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism proteins was predictive of growth on this substrate. Our analysis also uncovered “partial” 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism pathways in two R. gnavus strains, which we determined constitute the canonical Neu5Ac catabolism pathway, previously unreported in this species. These results reveal a notable diversity of sialic acid catabolism across the R. gnavus species, an essential consideration for further investigations into the importance of this metabolism in mucin degradation and in roles of R. gnavus in IBD and other gut dysbioses."

It is a complex microbial community of trillions of microbes with a majority of its members represented within two phyla, the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, although it also contains species of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Reflecting its importance, the HGM is sometimes referred to as an 'organ' as it performs functions analogous to systemic tissues within the human host. The major nutrients available to the HGM are host and dietary complex carbohydrates. To utilise these nutrient sources, the HGM has developed elaborate, variable and sophisticated systems for the sensing, capture and utilisation of these glycans. Understanding nutrient acquisition by the HGM can thus provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics of this ecosystem, and how it impacts human health. Dietary nutrient sources include a wide variety of simple and complex plant and animal-derived glycans most of which are not degraded by enzymes in the digestive tract of the host. Here we review how various adaptive mechanisms that operate across the major phyla of the HGM contribute to glycan utilisation, focusing on the most complex carbohydrates presented to this ecosystem."

 Mucus-digesting Ruminococcus gnavus (R. gnavus), adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are enriched in active Crohn’s disease (CD) patients compared to healthy subjects. Dual colonization of R. gnavus and E. coli LF82 in ex-germ-free mice enhanced distal colitis and H2S production in cecal contents. R. gnavus pre-digestion of mucus enhanced the ileal CD isolate AIEC LF82 growth and H2S production in vitro. H2S enhanced LF82 adhesion and invasion both in vitro and in vivo along with related LF82 adhesion gene expression and Caco-2 cell expression of CEACAM6, a receptor for AIEC ligand FimH. Interactions between other CD-derived AIEC/non-AIEC and R. gnavus are unknown.
 
 
 
 Different AIEC and non-AIEC may grow and produce H2S differently using mucus digested by R. gnavus, which releases mucus-derived monosaccharides and sulfur substrates.
 
 
 
 We studied CD-derived clinical isolates of AIEC 541-15 (phylotype A), 541-1 (B1), LF82 and NRG857c (B2) and non-AIEC T75 (A) and lab strain K12 (A). M9 minimal media was supplemented with porcine gastric mucin (PGM), ileal (MIM) and colonic (MCoM) mucus isolated from germ-free mice. We measured growth kinetics and H2S production by these AIEC and non-AIEC following culture with sterile supernatants of each mucin/mucus media precultured with or without R. gnavus, monosaccharides obtained by R. gnavus digestion of mucus, and several sulfur substrates in the gut added to M9 minimal media.
 
 
 
 AIEC, especially LF82 (B2), grew better with ileal mucus aerobically and, to a lesser extent, anaerobically than non-AIEC strains, with even greater AIEC growth with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus (Fig.1). AIEC produced more H2S with R. gnavus-precultured mucus than with mucus alone. R. gnavus digestion of PGM released mucus monosaccharides (Fig.2A). AIEC strains grew differently with each monosaccharide constituent of R. gnavus pre-digested PGM. AIEC grew better than non-AIEC with each monosaccharide in aerobic conditions, but AIEC (B2) grew better than others in all monosaccharides in anaerobic conditions (Fig.2B). Amongst mucus-relevant sulfur substrates, L-cysteine was the only substrate to enhance E. coli H2S production by all AIEC and non-AIEC strains. All mucus-relevant sulfur substrates supported R. gnavus survival for 24 hrs, while H2S sustained R. gnavus for 48 hrs in minimum media.
 
 
 
 AIEC grew better and produced more H2S with R. gnavus pre-digested mucus suggesting that co-existence of AIEC with R. gnavus mutually support each other and may explain why they are often observed together in active CD patients. In addition, enhanced AIEC growth with ileal vs. colonic mucus may explain why AIEC are frequently isolated from ileal CD patients. AIEC phylotype growth differences with mucus substrates may explain their persistence in the ileal mucosa.

Whether R. gnavus metabolites can modulate host intestinal physiology remains largely understudied. We performed untargeted metabolomic and bulk RNA-seq analyses using R. gnavus monocolonization in germ-free mice. Based on transcriptome-metabolome correlations, we tested the impact of specific arginine metabolites on intestinal epithelial production of nitric oxide (NO) and examined the effect of NO on the growth of various strains of R. gnavus in vitro and in nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2)-deficient mice. R. gnavus produces specific arginine, tryptophan, and tyrosine metabolites, some of which are regulated by the environmental richness of sialic acid and mucin. R. gnavus colonization promotes expression of amino acid transporters and enzymes involved in metabolic flux of arginine and associated metabolites into NO. R. gnavus induced elevated levels of NOS2, while Nos2 ablation resulted in R. gnavus expansion in vivo. The growth of various R. gnavus strains can be inhibited by NO. Specific R. gnavus metabolites modulate intestinal epithelial cell NOS2 abundance and reduce epithelial barrier function at higher concentrations. Intestinal colonization and interaction with R. gnavus are partially regulated by an arginine-NO metabolic pathway, whereby a balanced control by the gut epithelium may restrain R. gnavus growth in healthy individuals. Disruption in this arginine metabolic regulation will contribute to the expansion and blooming of R. gnavus."

While several mucin degrading bacteria have been identified, the inter-individual differences in microbial communities capable of metabolizing this complex polymer are not well described. To determine whether community assembly on mucin is deterministic across individuals or whether taxonomically distinct but functionally similar mucin-degrading communities are selected across fecal inocula, we used a ten-day in vitro sequential batch culture fermentation from three human donors with mucin as the sole carbon source. For each donor, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize microbial community succession, and the short-chain fatty acid profile was determined from the final community. All three communities reached a steady-state by day seven in which the community composition stabilized. Taxonomic comparisons amongst communities revealed that one of the final communities had Desulfovibrio, another had Akkermansia, and all three shared other members, such as Bacteroides. Metabolic output differences were most notable for one of the donor's communities, with significantly less production of acetate and propionate than the other two communities. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing stable mucin-degrading communities with shared and unique taxa. Furthermore, the mechanisms and efficiencies of mucin degradation across individuals are important for understanding how this community-level process impacts human health."

Within the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all Akkermansia glycaniphila and muciniphila genomes harbored multiple gene copies of mucin-degrading GHs. The only representative of the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victivallales, harbored a GH profile that closely mirrored Akkermansia. In the Actinobacteria phylum, we found several Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species with mucin-degrading GHs. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermenitomonas Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species had mucin degrading GHs. Firmicutes contained Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species with mucin-degrading GHs. Interestingly, far fewer mucin-degrading GHs were observed in the Proteobacteria phylum and were found in Klebsiella, Mixta, Serratia and Enterobacter species. We confirmed the mucin-degrading capability of 23 representative gut microbes using a chemically defined media lacking glucose supplemented with porcine intestinal mucus. These data greatly expand our knowledge of microbial-mediated mucin degradation within the human gut microbiota. "

Previously, we identified an α-galactosidase (Aga1) belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 36 from R. gnavus E1 (M. Aguilera, H. Rakotoarivonina, A. Brutus, T. Giardina, G. Simon, and M. Fons, Res. Microbiol. 163:14–21, 2012). Here, we identified a novel GH36-encoding gene from the same strain and termed it aga2. Although aga1 showed a very simple genetic organization, aga2 is part of an operon of unique structure, including genes putatively encoding a regulator, a GH13, two phosphotransferase system (PTS) sequences, and a GH32, probably involved in extracellular and intracellular sucrose assimilation. The 727-amino-acid (aa) deduced Aga2 protein shares approximately 45% identity with Aga1. Both Aga1 and Aga2 expressed in Escherichia coli showed strict specificity for α-linked galactose. Both enzymes were active on natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. Aga1 and Aga2 occurred as homotetramers in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. Modeling of Aga1 and Aga2 identified key amino acids which may be involved in substrate specificity and stabilization of the α-linked galactoside substrates within the active site. Furthermore, Aga1 and Aga2 were both able to perform transglycosylation reactions with α-(1,6) regioselectivity, leading to the formation of product structures up to [Hex]12 and [Hex]8, respectively. We suggest that Aga1 and Aga2 play essential roles in the metabolism of dietary oligosaccharides and could be used for the design of galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotics, known to selectively modulate the beneficial gut microbiota."

These bacteria play many beneficial roles and in some cases can modify disease states, making it important to understand which nutrients sustain specific lineages. ABSTRACT Symbiotic bacteria are responsible for the majority of complex carbohydrate digestion in the human colon. Since the identities and amounts of dietary polysaccharides directly impact the gut microbiota, determining which microorganisms consume specific nutrients is central for defining the relationship between diet and gut microbial ecology. Using a custom phenotyping array, we determined carbohydrate utilization profiles for 354 members of the Bacteroidetes, a dominant saccharolytic phylum. There was wide variation in the numbers and types of substrates degraded by individual bacteria, but phenotype-based clustering grouped members of the same species indicating that each species performs characteristic roles. The ability to utilize dietary polysaccharides and endogenous mucin glycans was negatively correlated, suggesting exclusion between these niches. By analyzing related Bacteroides ovatus/Bacteroides xylanisolvens strains that vary in their ability to utilize mucin glycans, we addressed whether gene clusters that confer this complex, multilocus trait are being gained or lost in individual strains. Pangenome reconstruction of these strains revealed a remarkably mosaic architecture in which genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism are highly variable and bioinformatics data provide evidence of interspecies gene transfer that might explain this genomic heterogeneity. Global transcriptomic analyses suggest that the ability to utilize mucin has been lost in some lineages of B. ovatus and B. xylanisolvens, which harbor residual gene clusters that are involved in mucin utilization by strains that still actively express this phenotype. Our data provide insight into the breadth and complexity of carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome and the underlying genomic events that shape these behaviors. IMPORTANCE Nonharmful bacteria are the primary microbial symbionts that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria play many beneficial roles and in some cases can modify disease states, making it important to understand which nutrients sustain specific lineages. This knowledge will in turn lead to strategies to intentionally manipulate the gut microbial ecosystem. We designed a scalable, high-throughput platform for measuring the ability of gut bacteria to utilize polysaccharides, of which many are derived from dietary fiber sources that can be manipulated easily. Our results provide paths to expand phenotypic surveys of more diverse gut bacteria to understand their functions and also to leverage dietary fibers to alter the physiology of the gut microbial community."

Its catalytic domain, belonging to glycoside hydrolase GH33 family, cleaves off terminal sialic acid residues from mucins, releasing 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac which is then used as metabolic substrate by R. gnavus to proliferate in the mucosal environment. RgNanH is one of the three intramolecular trans-sialidases (IT-sialidases) characterised to date, and the first from a gut commensal organism. Here, saturation transfer difference NMR (STD NMR) in combination with computational techniques (molecular docking and CORCEMA-ST) were used to elucidate the specificity, kinetics and relative affinity of RgNanH for sialoglycans and 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac. We propose the first 3D model for the Michaelis complex of an IT-sialidase. This confirms the sialic acid to be the main recognition element for the interaction in the enzymatic cleft and highlights the crucial role of Trp698 to make CH-π stacking with the galactose residue of the substrate 3'-sialyllactose. The same contact is shown not to be possible for 6'-sialyllactose, due to geometrical constrains of the α-2,6 linkage. Indeed 6'-sialyllactose is not a substrate, even though it is shown to bind to RgNanH by STD NMR. These findings corroborate the role of Trp698 for the α-2,3 specificity of IT-sialidases. In this structural study, the use of Differential Epitope Mapping STD NMR (DEEP-STD NMR) approach allowed the validation of the proposed 3D models in solution. These structural approaches are shown to be instrumental in shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning enzymatic reactions in the absence of enzyme-substrate X-ray structures."

Alterations in mucosal carbohydrate availability impact on the composition of microbial species. Ruminococcus gnavus is a commensal anaerobe present in the gastrointestinal tract of >90% of humans and overrepresented in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Using a combination of genomics, enzymology and crystallography, we show that the mucin-degrader R. gnavus ATCC 29149 strain produces an intramolecular trans-sialidase (IT-sialidase) that cleaves off terminal α2-3-linked sialic acid from glycoproteins, releasing 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac instead of sialic acid. Evidence of IT-sialidases in human metagenomes indicates that this enzyme occurs in healthy subjects but is more prevalent in IBD metagenomes. Our results uncover a previously unrecognized enzymatic activity in the gut microbiota, which may contribute to the adaptation of intestinal bacteria to the mucosal environment in health and disease."

Gut mucin degraders of healthy subjects were investigated, through a culture dependent and independent approach. The faeces of five healthy adults were subjected to three steps of anaerobic enrichment in a medium with sole mucins as carbon and nitrogen sources. The bacterial community was compared before and after the enrichment by 16S rRNA gene profiling. Bacteria capable of fermenting sugars, such as Anaerotruncus, Holdemania, and Enterococcaceae likely took advantage of the carbohydrate chains. Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae, Peptococcales, the Coriobacteriale Eggerthella, and a variety of Clostridia such as Oscillospiraceae, Anaerotruncus, and Lachnoclostridium, significantly increased and likely participated to the degradation of the protein backbone of mucin. The affinity of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae for mucin may facilitate the access to the gut mucosa, promoting gut barrier damage and triggering systemic inflammatory responses. Only three species of strict anaerobes able to grow on mucin were isolated from the enrichments of five different microbiota: Clostridium disporicum, Clostridium tertium, and Paraclostridium benzoelyticum. The limited number of species isolated confirms that in the gut the degradation of these glycoproteins results from cooperation and cross-feeding among several species exhibiting different metabolic capabilities."

Here we report on the enzyme-producing properties of five strains of mucin oligosaccharide chain-degrading bacteria isolated from feces of four healthy subjects. Four were isolated from the greatest fecal dilutions yielding mucin side chain-degrading activity in culture, and thus were the numerically dominant side chain-degrading bacteria in their respective hosts. Three were Ruminococcus strains and two were Bifidobacterium strains. Two Ruminococcus torques strains, IX-70 and VIII-239, produced blood group A- and H-degrading alpha-glycosidase activities, sialidase, and the requisite beta-glycosidases; these strains released greater than 90% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses from hog gastric mucin during growth in culture. The Bifidobacterium strains lacked A-degrading activity but were otherwise similar; these released 60-80% of the anthrone-reacting hexoses but not the A antigenic structures from hog gastric mucin. Only Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268 produced blood group B-degrading alpha-galactosidase activity, but this strain lacked beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases to complete degradation of B antigenic chains. When this strain was co-cultured with a strain that produced beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases, release of hexoses from blood group B salivary glycoprotein increased from 50 to greater than 90%, and bacterial growth was enhanced. The glycosidases required for side chain degradation were produced by these strains in the absence of mucin substrate, and a substantial fraction of each activity in stationary phase cultures was extracellular. In contrast, none of 16 other fecal Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bifidobacterium strains produced ABH blood group-degrading enzymes; other glycosidases produced by these strains were predominantly cell bound except for extracellular beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases produced by the five S. faecalis strains. We conclude that certain Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains are numerically dominant populations degrading mucin oligosaccharides in the human colon due to their constitutive production of the requisite extracellular glycosidases including blood group antigen-specific alpha-glycosidases. These properties characterize them as a functionally distinct subpopulation of normal human enteric microflora comprised of specialized subsets that produce blood group H antigen-degrading glycosidases alone or together with either blood group A- or B-degrading glycosidases."

The importance of adequately stating the objective of the model in relation to the level of representation of rumen processes is stressed. No model yet exists which can accurately simulate rumen metabolism in all circumstances. A number of issues related to rumen modelling require further research. The sound representation of rumen microbial metabolism is essential. Aspects of microbial metabolism which deserve further attention include microbial distribution within the rumen, microbial interactions, and chemical composition of microbial matter. The representation of outflow from the rumen requires a more mechanistic approach, which should adequately cover continuous as well as discontinuous feeding regimes. Finally, the representation of VFA production is identified as being inadequate, and future attempts to improve prediction of VFA profile should include provisions for the effect of amount and rate of substrate degradation and microbial species preferences on type of VFA produced."

Ottman The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a complex community of micro-organisms, the gut microbiota. The majority of these are bacteria, which perform various functions involved in host energy metabolism and immune system stimulation. The field of gut microbiology is continuously expanding as novel species are isolated and high-throughput techniques are developed. The research focus is shifting from DNA-based techniques, looking at microbial community composition, to techniques relying on analysis of RNA and proteins, which reveal more about the activity and functionality of the microbiota. The mucosa-associated microbiota forms a distinct population in the gut, and is influenced by the close proximity of the epithelial layer and nutrients present in the mucus layer. One of the key players in this community is the mucus degrader Akkermansia muciniphila. This Gram-negative, anaerobic bacterium can use mucin, the main component of mucus, as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. A. muciniphila belongs to the phylum Verrucomicrobia and is present in the majority of humans, starting from early life. Interestingly, the levels of A. muciniphila are negatively correlated with several disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases and diabetes. A. muciniphila lives in a symbiosis with its host, harvesting energy from mucin; whether the relationship is mutualistic, and thereby also beneficial to the host, remains to be discovered. In this thesis, the ability of A. muciniphila to utilize the host-derived glycans mucin and human milk oligosaccharides was studied in detail. In addition, the host-bacterial interactions were examined by immunological assays, focusing especially on the effect of A. muciniphila outer membrane proteins on host immune response. The genome of A. muciniphila encodes numerous enzymes involved in mucin degradation. Transcriptome analysis comparing the gene expression of A. muciniphila grown on mucin or the non-mucin sugar glucose confirmed the activity of these genes and revealed most of them to be upregulated in the presence of mucin. This was also confirmed by a proteome analysis, reinforcing the adaptation of A. muciniphila to the mucosal environment. A genome-based metabolic model was constructed to test amino acid auxotrophy, vitamin biosynthesis, and sugar-degrading capacities of A. muciniphila. The model predicted A. muciniphila to be able to synthesize all the essential amino acids, with the exception of threonine, which was added to the mucin-free medium designed to test A. muciniphila growth on single sugars. A. muciniphila was able to individually metabolize all the main monomeric sugars present in mucin, albeit with limited efficiency in comparison to mucin. As mucin shares structural similarities with human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which stimulate the bacterial community colonizing the gut in early life, growth of A. muciniphila on human milk and its components was tested. A. muciniphila showed metabolic activity on human milk and one of the HMOs, 2’-fucosyllactose. Comparison of A. muciniphila activity during growth on human milk or mucin revealed that the expression of genes involved in mucin degradation was similar for both experimental conditions, suggesting that A. muciniphila might be capable of also using the corresponding gene products for utilization of human milk glycans. The capacity to survive in the early life environment by degrading and consuming human milk components would be beneficial for A. muciniphila during initial colonization before reaching the mucosal layer in the intestine. Several mouse studies have indicated that A. muciniphila is able to modulate the host immune system, possibly to the benefit of the host, but not much is known about its immunological mechanism of action. The cell envelope structures of bacteria can have a big influence on their immunostimulatory capacities, and therefore the outer membrane (OM) proteome of A. muciniphila was characterized. The membrane structure of A. muciniphila is also of interest because it belongs to the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae superphylum, which contains bacteria with features that differentiate them from classical Gram-negative bacteria, including a complex endomembrane system. Mass spectrometry data, coupled with bioinformatics analysis, revealed the presence of highly abundant OM proteins involved in secretion, transport and biogenesis of the Gram-negative membranes, as well as proteins predicted to take part in formation of the fimbriae-like structures observed in A. muciniphila by electron microscopy. Live A. muciniphila and the identified OM proteins induced production of a wide range of cytokines and activated the intestinal Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Moreover, a 30 kDa protein that was predicted to form a part of the fimbriae, increased transepithelial resistance, indicating it may be involved in improving gut barrier function. Based on the evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies, A. muciniphila is a promising candidate for a next-generation probiotic. However, further confirmation of causal relationships between disease development and presence of this species in the gut is required. The findings of this thesis provide valuable insight into the bacterial lifestyle and host interactions of the gut symbiont A. muciniphila."

Mucins are complex glycoproteins that contain heavily sulfated O-glycans and form the protective colonic mucus layer. Bacterial carbohydrate sulfatases are required to metabolise these heavily sulfated mucin glycans and excessive bacterial foraging has been associated with several diseases. Sulfatases have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease, making these microbiota enzymes potential drug targets. A. muciniphila expresses carbohydrate sulfatases that can act on colonic mucins yet their roles in its metabolism remain opaque. Our data reveal that A. muciniphila requires glycopeptides/protein forms of colonic mucin for metabolism and its sulfatases have unique adaptations compared to Bacteroides species. Localisation studies reveal that desulfation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, but not D-galactose, is exclusively periplasmic. A cell surface sulfatase has a novel carbohydrate binding module that binds to colonic mucin. This paints a contrasting picture of sulfated mucin metabolism by Akkermansia muciniphila versus Bacteroides species.

Despite the high density of bacteria that colonize the lower airways, nutrient sources that sustain bacterial growth in vivo, and how those nutrients are derived, are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the possibility that mucins serve as an important carbon reservoir for the CF lung microbiota. While Pseudomonas aeruginosa was unable to efficiently utilize mucins in isolation, we found that anaerobic, mucin-fermenting bacteria could stimulate the robust growth of CF pathogens when provided intact mucins as a sole carbon source. 16S rRNA sequencing and enrichment culturing of sputum also identified that mucin-degrading anaerobes are ubiquitous in the airways of CF patients. The collective fermentative metabolism of these mucin-degrading communities in vitro generated amino acids and short chain fatty acids (propionate and acetate) during growth on mucin, and the same metabolites were also found in abundance within expectorated sputum. The significance of these findings was supported by in vivo P. aeruginosa gene expression, which revealed a heightened expression of genes required for the catabolism of propionate. Given that propionate is exclusively derived from bacterial fermentation, these data provide evidence for an important role of mucin fermenting bacteria in the carbon flux of the lower airways. More specifically, microorganisms typically defined as commensals may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens otherwise unable to efficiently obtain carbon in the lung."

In this study, we present a characterization on the strains Clostridium celatum WC0700, Clostridium tertium WC0709, and Paraclostridium bifermentans WC0705. These three strains were previously isolated from enrichment cultures on mucin of fecal samples from healthy subjects and can use mucin as sole carbon and nitrogen source.

The potential pathogenicity of the strains was evaluated through in silico research of virulence factors. The merge between comparative and functional genomics and biochemical/physiological characterization provided a comprehensive view of these mucin degraders, reassuring on the safety of these species and leaving ample scope for deeper investigations on the relationship with the host and for assessing if some relevant health-promoting effect could be ascribed to these SCFA producing species."

Certain residents of this niche can degrade the large and complex mucin glycoproteins that constitute this layer and utilise the degradation products for their metabolism. In turn, this microbial mucin degradation drives specific microbiological ecological interactions in the human gut mucus layer. However, the exact nature of these interactions remains unknown. In this study, we designed and studied an in vitro mucin-degrading synthetic community that included mucin O-glycan degraders and cross-feeding microorganisms by monitoring community composition and dynamics through a combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, mucin glycan degradation with PGC-LC-MS/MS, production of mucin-degrading enzymes and other proteins through metaproteomics, and metabolite production with HPLC. We demonstrated that specialist and generalist mucin O-glycan degraders stably co-exist and found evidence for cross-feeding relationships. Cross-feeding on the products of mucin degradation by other gut microbes resulted in butyrate production, hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Metaproteomics analysis revealed that mucin glycan degraders Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides spp. and Ruminococcus torques together contributed 92% of the total mucin O-glycan degrading enzyme pool of this community. Furthermore, comparative proteomics showed that in response to cultivation in a community compared to monoculture, mucin glycan degraders increased carbohydrate-active enzymes whereas we also found indications for niche differentiation. These results confirm the complexity of mucin-driven microbiological ecological interactions and the intricate role of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the human gut mucus layer. "

Some gut bacteria utilize mucus as a nutrient source and can under certain conditions damage the protective barrier it forms, increasing disease susceptibility. We investigated how Ruminococcus torques—a known mucin-degrader that remains poorly studied despite its implication in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)— degrades mucin glycoproteins or their component O-linked glycans to understand its effects on the availability of mucin-derived nutrients for other bacteria. We found that R. torques utilizes both mucin glycoproteins and released oligosaccharides from gastric and colonic mucins, degrading these substrates with a panoply of mostly constitutively expressed, secreted enzymes. Investigation of mucin oligosaccharide degradation by R. torques revealed strong fucosidase, sialidase and β1,4-galactosidase activities. There was a lack of detectable sulfatase and weak β1,3-galactosidase degradation, resulting in accumulation of glycans containing these structures on mucin polypeptides. While the Gram-negative symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron grows poorly on mucin glycoproteins, we demonstrate a clear ability of R. torques to liberate products from mucins, making them accessible to B. thetaiotaomicron. This work underscores the diversity of mucin-degrading mechanisms in different bacterial species and the probability that some species are contingent on others for the ability to more fully access mucin-derived nutrients. The ability of R. torques to directly degrade a variety of mucin and mucin glycan structures and unlock released glycans for other species suggests that it is a keystone mucin degrader, which may contribute to its association with IBD. Importance An important facet of maintaining healthy symbiosis between host and intestinal microbes is the mucus layer, the first defense protecting the epithelium from lumenal bacteria. Some gut bacteria degrade different components of intestinal mucins, but detailed mechanisms used by different species are still emerging. It is imperative to understand these mechanisms as they likely dictate interspecies interactions and may illuminate particular species associated with bacterial mucus destruction and subsequent disease susceptibility. Ruminococcus torques is positively associated with IBD in multiple studies. We identified mucin glycan-degrading enzymes in R. torques and found that it shares mucin degradation products with another gut bacterium implicated in IBD, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding the mucin degradation mechanisms of different gut bacteria and their consequences on interspecies interactions, which may identify keystone bacteria that disproportionately contribute to defects in mucus protection and could therefore be targets to prevent or treat IBD."

Although several microbial species have been identified as mucin degraders, there are likely many other members of the healthy gut community with the capacity to degrade mucins. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota. Within the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all Akkermansia glycaniphila and muciniphila genomes harbored multiple gene copies of mucin-degrading GHs. The only representative of the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victivallales, harbored a GH profile that closely mirrored Akkermansia. In the Actinobacteria phylum, we found several Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species with mucin-degrading GHs. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermenitomonas Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species had mucin degrading GHs. Firmicutes contained Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species with mucin-degrading GHs. Interestingly, far fewer mucin-degrading GHs were observed in the Proteobacteria phylum and were found in Klebsiella, Mixta, Serratia and Enterobacter species. We confirmed the mucin-degrading capability of 23 representative gut microbes using a chemically defined media lacking glucose supplemented with porcine intestinal mucus. These data greatly expand our knowledge of microbial-mediated mucin degradation within the human gut microbiota. "

Pouchitis develops in former patients with UC after total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (“pouch surgery”) and is characterized by inflammation of the previously normal small intestine comprising the pouch. It has been extensively shown that broad taxonomic and functional alterations (“dysbiosis”) occur in the gut microbiome of patients with IBD. However, the extent to which microbial dysbiosis in pouchitis resembles that of CD or UC has not been investigated in-depth, and the pathogenesis of pouchitis largely remains unknown. Results In this study we collected 250 fecal metagenomes from 75 patients with a pouch, including both non-inflamed (normal pouch) and inflamed (pouchitis) phenotypes, and compared them to publicly available metagenomes of patients with CD (n=88), and UC (n=76), as well as healthy controls (n=56). Patients with pouchitis presented the highest level of dysbiosis compared to other IBD phenotypes based on species, metabolic pathways and enzyme profiles, and their level of dysbiosis was correlated with intestinal inflammation. In patients with pouchitis, the microbiome mucin degradation potential was lower, but was accompanied by an enrichment of Ruminococcus gnavus strains encoding specific mucin-degrading glycoside hydrolases, which might be pro-inflammatory. Butyrate and secondary bile acids producers were decreased in all IBD phenotypes and were especially low in pouchitis. Butyrate synthesis genes were positively correlated with total dietary fiber intake. Patients with pouchitis harbored more facultative anaerobic bacteria encoding enzymes involved in oxidative stress response, suggesting high oxidative stress during pouch inflammation. Finally, we have developed enzymes-based classifiers that can distinguish between patients with a normal pouch and pouchitis with an area under the curve of 0.91. Conclusions We propose that the non-inflamed pouch is already dysbiotic (function- and species-wise) and microbially is more similar to CD than to UC. Our study reveals microbial functions that underlie the pathogenesis of pouchitis and suggests bacterial groups and functions that could be targeted for nutritional intervention to attenuate or prevent small intestinal inflammation present in pouchitis and CD."

We previously showed that the ability of R. gnavus to forage on mucins is strain-dependent and associated with sialic acid metabolism. Here, we showed that mice monocolonized with R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (Rg-mice) display changes in major sialic acid derivatives in their cecum content, blood, and brain, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in the percentage of sialylated residues in intestinal mucins relative to germ-free (GF) mice. Changes in metabolites associated with brain function such as tryptamine, indolacetate, and trimethylamine N-oxide were also detected in the cecal content of Rg-mice when compared to GF mice. Next, we investigated the effect of R. gnavus monocolonization on hippocampus cell proliferation and behavior. We observed a significant decrease of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Rg-mice as compared to GF mice and recruitment of phagocytic microglia in the vicinity. Behavioral assessments suggested an improvement of the spatial working memory in Rg-mice but no change in other cognitive functions. These results were also supported by a significant upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and neuroplasticity. Collectively, these data provide first insights into how R. gnavus metabolites may influence brain regulation and function through modulation of granule cell development and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus. This work has implications for further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the role of R. gnavus in neurological disorders."

However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown owing to a lack of suitable experimental models. Although most gut commensals are anaerobic, intestinal epithelial cells require oxygen for survival. In addition, most intestinal cell lines do not produce mucus, which provides a habitat for the microbiota. Here, we have developed a microaerobic, mucus-producing vertical diffusion chamber (VDC) model and determined the influence of Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Ruminococcus gnavus on enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection. Optimization of the culture medium enabled bacterial growth in the presence of mucus-producing T84/LS174T cells. Whereas L. reuteri diminished EPEC growth and adhesion to T84/LS174T and mucus-deficient T84 epithelia, R. gnavus only demonstrated a protective effect in the presence of LS174T cells. Reduced EPEC adherence was not associated with altered type III secretion pore formation. In addition, co-culture with L. reuteri and R. gnavus dampened EPEC-induced interleukin 8 secretion. The microaerobic mucin-producing VDC system will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms underpinning colonization resistance and aid the development of microbiota-based anti-infection strategies.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on rumen protein degradation and measurement methods; no mention of Ruminococcus gnavus, mucin, or related in‑vitro assays.","Advances in knowledge of ruminant nutrition and metabolism during the second half of the twentieth century have been reviewed. Part I is concerned with metabolism in the rumen: Part II discusses utilization of nutrients absorbed from the rumen and lower tract to support growth and reproduction. The time frame was prompted by the crucial advances in ruminant physiology which arose from the work of Sir Jospeh Barcroft and his colleagues at Cambridge in the 1940s and 50s, and by the brilliant studies of Robert Hungate on rumen microbiology at much the same time.In reviewing the growth of knowledge of the role of bacteria, protozoa, fungi and bacteriophages in the rumen, outstanding developments have included the identification and characterization of fungi and the recognition that the utilization of polysaccharides in the rumen is accomplished by the sequential activities of consortia of rumen microorganisms. The role of protozoa is discussed in relation to the long standing debate on whether or not the removal of protozoa (defaunation) improves the efficiency of ruminant production. In relation to nitrogen (N) metabolism, the predation of bacteria by protozoa increases protein turnover in the rumen and reduces the efficiency of microbial protein production. This may account for the beneficial effects of defaunation where dietary N intakes are low and possibly rate limiting for growth and production.Current approaches to the measurement of rates of production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the rumen based on the mathematical modelling of isotope dilution data are outlined. The absorption of SCFA from the rumen and hindgut is primarily a passive permeation process.The role of microorganisms in N metabolism in the rumen has been discussed in relation to ammonia and urea interrelationships and to current inadequacies in the measurement of both protein degradation in the rumen and microbial protein synthesis. The growth of knowledge of digestion and absorption of dietary lipids has been reviewed with emphasis on the antimicrobial activity of lipids and the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. The protection of unsaturated dietary fats from ruminal biohydrogenation is an approach to the manipulation of the fatty acid composition of meat and dairy products.Discussion of the production of toxins in the rumen and the role of microorganisms in detoxification has focused on the metabolism of oxalate, nitrate, mycotoxins, saponins and the amino acid mimosine. Mimosine occurs in the tropical shrub leucaena, which is toxic to cattle in Australia but not in Hawaii. Tolerance to leucaena stems from the presence of a bacterium found in the rumen of Hawaiian cattle, which when transferred to Australian cattle survives and confers protection from mimosine. The genetic modification of rumen microorganisms to improve their capacity to ultilize nutrients or to detoxify antinutritive factors is an attractive strategy which has been pursued with outstanding success in the case of fluoroacetate. A common rumen bacterium has been genetically modified to express the enzyme fluoroacetate dehalogenase. The modified organism has been shown to survive in the rumen at metabolically significant levels and to confer substantial protection from fluoroacetate poisoning."

In the first, isoproteic diets, constituted of elephant grass, ground corn and soybean meal, at five concentrate levels (0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 e 100:0), with or without monensin (5µM), were incubated in ruminal fluid of bovines. There was a decreasing linear effect of the concentrate level on ammonia concentration and degradability of crude protein, and cubic effect in soluble protein concentration, with the largest value in the diet with 25% concentrate. Monensin decreased degradability of crude protein and soluble protein concentration with no effect on ammonia production. In the second, five different roughages (corn and elephant grass silage - Pennisetum purpureum, Brachiaria haylage - Brachiaria decumbens, ammoniated Tifton 85 hay - Cynodon sp. e Tifton 85 hay). The were incubated Brachiaria haylage and the ammoniated Tifton 85 hay showed the greatest concentrations of ammonia (8.7 and 5.3mg/dl) and soluble protein (5.4 and 7.0mg/dl), due to their higher crude protein content, followed by elephant grass silage and Tifton 85 hay. The degradability of crude protein ranged from 29.6 to 80.6% for Brachiaria haylage and Tifton 85 hay, and the degradability of dry matter ranged from 40.1 to 64.3% for elephant grass silage and Brachiaria haylage, respectively. The effective degradability of crude protein showed low values due to low degradation rate of the insoluble fraction. In the third, four different poultry litter (hulls coffee, shopped dry elephant grass, corn cobs and wood shavings) were incubated, with or without monensin (5µM). No difference in ammonia concentration among the poultry litter samples, was observed in the absence of monensin. However, when monensin was present, the grass poultry litter showed the lowest ammonia level and wood poultry litter the highest. The poultry litter influenced the soluble protein content and the degradability of crude protein, which ranged from 9.0 to 14.5 mg/dl and 39 to 63%, respectively, with no monensin effects."

The main cause of nitrogen-(N)-containing emissions is the inadequate provision of N to ruminants, leading to an excess of ammonia in the rumen, which is subsequently excreted. Depending on the size and molecular structure, various bacterial, protozoal and fungal species are involved in the ruminal breakdown of nitrogenous compounds (NC). Decelerating ruminal NC degradation by controlling the abundance and activity of proteolytic and deaminating microorganisms, but without reducing cellulolytic processes, is a promising strategy to decrease N emissions along with increasing N utilization by ruminants. Different dietary options, including among others the treatment of feedstuffs with heat or the application of diverse feed additives, as well as vaccination against rumen microorganisms or their enzymes have been evaluated. Thereby, reduced productions of microbial metabolites, e.g. ammonia, and increased microbial N flows give evidence for an improved N retention. However, linkage between these findings and alterations in the rumen microbiota composition, particularly NC-degrading microbes, remains sparse and contradictory findings confound the exact evaluation of these manipulating strategies, thus emphasizing the need for comprehensive research. The demand for increased sustainability in ruminant livestock production requests to apply attention to microbial N utilization efficiency and this will require a better understanding of underlying metabolic processes as well as composition and interactions of ruminal NC-degrading microorganisms."

Thirty animals were divided into 3 groups: control (without supplement), ionophore (500 g t-1 of Rumensin ® ) and yeast (500 g t-1 of Beefsac ® ), were used. These animals were kept in semi-confinement, receiving the feed equivalent to 2% of their live weight. Samples of the ruminal fluid were collected every 7 days, in order to determine the pH, redox potential, time of sedimentation and fluctuation, color, odor, consistency and protozoa movement. The same interval was used for blood sampling collection. The concentrations of glucose, urea, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, albumin, oxaloacetic transaminase and γ-glutaril-transferase were determined. The yeast group presented lower values (p 0.05). In relation to metabolic parameters, differences (p > 0.05) in concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol, albumin and oxaloacetic transaminase were not observed.

- **Reasoning:** Review summarizes mucin‑degrading enzymes across taxa; no original R. gnavus experiments, growth assays, metabolic data, or controls are presented.","The gut microbiota interacts with the host through the mucus that covers and protects the gastrointestinal epithelium. The main component of the mucus are mucins, glycoproteins decorated with hundreds of different O-glycans. Some microbiota members can utilize mucin O-glycans as carbons source. To degrade these host glycans the bacteria express multiple carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) such as glycoside hydrolases, sulfatases and esterases which are active on specific linkages. The studies of these enzymes in an in vivo context have started to reveal their importance in mucin utilization and gut colonization. It is now clear that bacteria evolved multiple specific CAZymes to overcome the diversity of linkages found in O-glycans. Additionally, changes in mucin degradation by gut microbiota have been associated with diseases like obesity, diabetes, irritable bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Thereby understanding how CAZymes from different bacteria work to degrade mucins is of critical importance to develop new treatments and diagnostics for these increasingly prevalent health problems. This mini-review covers the recent advances in biochemical characterization of mucin O-glycan-degrading CAZymes and how they are connected to human health. "

Some organisms (e.g., Bacteroides spp.) isolated on other substrates also utilized mucin, but were not isolated in the mucin enrichment. The mucin fermenters isolated by enrichment had a very restricted ability to utilize complex polysaccharides and their constituent monosaccharides, suggesting that the presence of plant polysaccharides in the human colon is unlikely to prevent the use of colonic mucin as an energy source by bacteria. Characterization with a range of biochemical tests showed that many of the isolates, but especially the mucin fermenters, did not resemble organisms described previously."

In this study, we performed non-targeted fecal metabolomics in AS in order to discover the microbiome–metabolome interface in AS. Based on prospective cohort studies, we further explored the impact of the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) on the gut microbiota and metabolites in AS.To further understand the gut microbiota and metabolites in AS, along with the influence of TNFi, we initiated a prospective cohort study. Fecal samples were collected from 29 patients with AS before and after TNFi therapy and 31 healthy controls. Metagenomic and metabolomic experiments were performed on the fecal samples; moreover, validation experiments were conducted based on the association between the microbiota and metabolites.A total of 7,703 species were annotated using the metagenomic sequencing system and by profiling the microbial community taxonomic composition, while 50,046 metabolites were identified using metabolite profiling. Differential microbials and metabolites were discovered between patients with AS and healthy controls. Moreover, TNFi was confirmed to partially restore the gut microbiota and the metabolites. Multi-omics analysis of the microbiota and metabolites was performed to determine the associations between the differential microbes and metabolites, identifying compounds such as oxypurinol and biotin, which were correlated with the inhibition of the pathogenic bacteria Ruminococcus gnavus and the promotion of the probiotic bacteria Bacteroides uniformis. Through experimental studies, the relationship between microbes and metabolites was further confirmed, and the impact of these two types of microbes on the enterocytes and the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) was explored.In summary, multi-omics exploration elucidated the impact of TNFi on the gut microbiota and metabolites and proposed a novel therapeutic perspective: supplementation of compounds to inhibit potential pathogenic bacteria and to promote potential probiotics, therefore controlling inflammation in AS."

From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the biological characterisation of R. gnavus, its occurrence in the infant and adult gut microbiota and the factors influencing its colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract; we also discuss the current state of our knowledge on its role in host health and disease. We highlight gaps in knowledge and discuss the hypothesis that differential health outcomes associated with R. gnavus in the gut are strain and niche specific."

The molecular cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the gut play an important role in the maintenance of the intestinal homeostasis and general health. Here, we studied the impact of a major Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium of the human gut microbiota, that is, Ruminococcus gnavus on the glycosylation pattern and the production of intestinal mucus by the goblet cells.

Methods and Results
Our results showed that R. gnavus E1 specifically increases the expression and the glycosylation level of the intestinal glyco-conjugates by goblet cells in the colonic mucosa of mono-associated mice with R. gnavus E1 as well as in human HT29-MTX cells. Such an effect was mediated through induction of the level of mRNA encoding for the major intestinal gel-forming mucin such as MUC2 and various glycosyltransferase enzymes.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time that R. gnavus E1 possess the ability to modulate the glycosylation profile of the glyco-conjugate molecules and mucus in goblet cells.

Significance and Impact of the Study
Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. gnavus E1 modified specifically the glycosylation pattern and MUC2 expression by means of a small soluble factor of peptidic nature (<3 kDa) and heat stable in the HT29-MTX cell."

Since the identities and amounts of dietary polysaccharides directly impact the gut microbiota, determining which microorganisms consume specific nutrients is central to defining the relationship between diet and gut microbial ecology. Using a custom phenotyping array, we determined carbohydrate utilization profiles for 354 members of the Bacteroidetes, a dominant saccharolytic phylum. There was wide variation in the numbers and types of substrates degraded by individual bacteria, but phenotype-based clustering grouped members of the same species indicating that each species performs characteristic roles. The ability to utilize dietary polysaccharides and endogenous mucin glycans was negatively correlated, suggesting exclusion between these niches. By analyzing related Bacteroides ovatus/xylanisolvens strains that vary in their ability to utilize mucin glycans, we addressed whether gene clusters that confer this complex, multi-locus trait are being gained or lost in individual strains. Pangenome reconstruction of these strains revealed a remarkably mosaic architecture in which genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism are highly variable and bioinformatics data provide evidence of interspecies gene transfer that might explain this genomic heterogeneity. Global transcriptomic analyses suggest that the ability to utilize mucin has been lost in some lineages of B. ovatus and B. xylanisolvens, which still harbor residual gene clusters that are involved in mucin utilization by strains that still actively express this phenotype. Our data provide insight into the breadth and complexity of carbohydrate metabolism in the microbiome and the underlying genomic events that shape these behaviors."

Colonic mucus consists of a loose outer layer and a dense epithelium-attached layer. The outer layer is inhabited by various representatives of the human gut microbiota (HGM). Glycans of the colonic mucus can be used by the HGM as a source of carbon and energy when dietary fibers are not sufficiently available. Both commensals and pathogens can utilize mucin glycans. Commensals are mostly involved in the cleavage of glycans, while pathogens mostly utilize monosaccharides released by commensals. This HGM-derived degradation of the mucus layer increases pathogen susceptibility and causes many other health disorders. Here, we analyzed 397 individual HGM genomes to identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides. Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, which significantly higher than a previous estimation. (ii) Genes for the catabolism of derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (iii) Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of monosaccharide transporters. (iv) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes may be involved in potential feeding pathways for the monosaccharides derived from cleaved mucin glycans. (v) The analyzed genomes demonstrated different abilities to degrade known mucin glycans. Generally, the ability to degrade at least one type of mucin glycan was predicted for 81% of the analyzed genomes. (vi) Eighty-two percent of the analyzed genomes can form mutualistic pairs that are able to degrade mucin glycans and are not degradable by any of the paired organisms alone. Taken together, these findings provide further insight into the inter-microbial communications of the HGM as well as into host-HGM interactions."

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on rumen metabolic modeling, not on Ruminococcus gnavus or mucin utilization experiments.","All mechanistic rumen models cover the main drivers of variation in rumen function, which are feed intake, the differences between feedstuffs and feeds in their intrinsic rumen degradation characteristics, and fractional outflow rate of fluid and particulate matter. Dynamic modeling approaches are best suited to the prediction of more nuanced responses in rumen metabolism, and represent the dynamics of the interactions between substrates and micro-organisms and inter-microbial interactions. The concepts of dynamics are discussed for the case of rumen starch digestion as influenced by starch intake rate and frequency of feed intake, and for the case of fermentation of fiber in the large intestine. Adding representations of new functional classes of micro-organisms (i.e., with new characteristics from the perspective of whole rumen function) in rumen models only delivers new insights if complemented by the dynamics of their interactions with other functional classes. Rumen fermentation conditions have to be represented due to their profound impact on the dynamics of substrate degradation and microbial metabolism. Although the importance of rumen pH is generally acknowledged, more emphasis is needed on predicting its variation as well as variation in the processes that underlie rumen fluid dynamics. The rumen wall has an important role in adapting to rapid changes in the rumen environment, clearing of volatile fatty acids (VFA), and maintaining rumen pH within limits. Dynamics of rumen wall epithelia and their role in VFA absorption needs to be better represented in models that aim to predict rumen responses across nutritional or physiological states. For a detailed prediction of rumen N balance there is merit in a dynamic modeling approach compared to the static approaches adopted in current protein evaluation systems. Improvement is needed on previous attempts to predict rumen VFA profiles, and this should be pursued by introducing factors that relate more to microbial metabolism. For rumen model construction, data on rumen microbiomes are preferably coupled with knowledge consolidated in rumen models instead of relying on correlations with rather general aspects of treatment or animal. This helps to prevent the disregard of basic principles and underlying mechanisms of whole rumen function."

Mucin glycan utilization requires the removal of protective caps, notably fucose and sialic acid, but the enzymatic details of this process remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the specificities of ten A. muciniphila glycoside hydrolases, which collectively remove all known sialyl and fucosyl mucin caps including those on double-sulfated epitopes. Structural analyses revealed an unprecedented fucosidase modular arrangement and explained the sialyl T-antigen specificity of a sialidase of a previously unknown family. Cell-attached sialidases and fucosidases displayed mucin-binding and their inhibition abolished growth of A. muciniphila on mucin. Remarkably, neither the sialic acid nor fucose contributed to A. muciniphila growth, but instead promoted butyrate production by co-cultured Clostridia. This study brings unprecedented mechanistic insight into the initiation of mucin O -glycan degradation by A. muciniphila and nutrient sharing between mucus-associated bacteria. "

Several studies using both bacterial culture techniques and bio-molecular methods revealed that the amniotic cavity harbors microorganisms and, among them, uncultivated and uncharacterized taxa. The aim of the present PhD thesis was to evaluate the composition of some neglected populations inhabiting the infant gut microbiota until the second year of life. The PhD thesis is composed of three main chapters related to the presence of hydrogenotrophic populations, the occurrence of the Lachnospiraceae family in healthy subjects before the second year and the possible linkage between methanogens and diet in a piglet’s model. PCR-DGGE, the quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the Illumina deep sequencing have been the prevalent molecular techniques used in this work. Main conclusions obtained from these studies were mainly linked to the need of new primer sets that better describe the ecological complexity of the gut microbial community.

The average of production was 17 kg for LAB, of 14 kg/d in silvopastoril system (SP) and 16 kg in CP (P<0.05). The saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids showed differences in the three treatments (P<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega 3 and conjugated linoleic acid were 34%, 46% and 68% higher in CP, silvopastoral system and LAB compared to commercial milk (CM).

Yet, many of its bacterial constituents are functionally still largely unexplored. A crucial prerequisite for bacterial survival and proliferation is the creation and/or exploitation of an own niche. For many bacterial species that are linked to human disease, the inner mucus layer was found to be an important niche. Allobaculum mucolyticum is a newly identified, IBD-associated species that is thought be closely associated with the host epithelium. To explore how this bacterium is able to effectively colonize this niche, we screened its genome for factors that may contribute to mucosal colonization. Up to 60 genes encoding putative Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) were identified in the genome of A. mucolyticum. Mass spectrometry revealed 49 CAZymes of which 26 were significantly enriched in its secretome. Functional assays demonstrated the presence of CAZyme activity in A. mucolyticum conditioned medium, degradation of human mucin O-glycans, and utilization of liberated non-terminal monosaccharides for bacterial growth. The results support a model in which sialidases and fucosidases remove terminal O-glycan sugars enabling subsequent degradation and utilization of carbohydrates for A. mucolyticum growth. A. mucolyticum CAZyme secretion may thus facilitate bacterial colonization and degradation of the mucus layer and may pose an interesting target for future therapeutic intervention."

In particular, some gut bacteria have the ability to forage on glycans provided by the mucus layer covering the GI tract. The O-glycan structures present in mucin are diverse and complex, consisting predominantly of core 1-4 mucin-type O-glycans containing α- and β- linked N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine. These core structures are further elongated and frequently modified by fucose and sialic acid sugar residues via α1,2/3/4 and α2,3/6 linkages, respectively. The ability to metabolize these mucin O-linked oligosaccharides is likely to be a key factor in determining which bacterial species colonise the mucosal surface. Due to their proximity to the immune system, mucin-degrading bacteria are in a prime location to influence the host response. However, despite the growing number of bacterial genome sequences available from mucin degraders, our knowledge on the structural requirements for mucin degradation by gut bacteria remains fragmented. This is largely due to the limited number of functionally characterized enzymes and the lack of studies correlating the specificity of these enzymes with the ability of the strain to degrade and utilize mucin and mucin glycans. This review focuses on recent findings unravelling the molecular strategies used by mucin-degrading bacteria to utilise host glycans, adapt to the mucosal environment, and influence human health."

Some gut bacteria utilize mucus as a nutrient source and can under certain conditions damage the protective barrier it forms, increasing disease susceptibility. We investigated how Ruminococcus torques— a known mucin degrader that has been implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)—degrades mucin glycoproteins or their component O -linked glycans to understand its effects on the availability of mucin-derived nutrients for other bacteria. We found that R. torques utilizes both mucin glycoproteins and released oligosaccharides from gastric and colonic mucins, degrading these substrates with a panoply of mostly constitutively expressed, secreted enzymes. Investigation of mucin oligosaccharide degradation by R. torques revealed strong α-L-fucosidase, sialidase and β1,4-galactosidase activities. There was a lack of detectable sulfatase and weak β1,3-galactosidase degradation, resulting in accumulation of glycans containing these structures on mucin polypeptides. While the Gram-negative symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron grows poorly on mucin glycoproteins, we demonstrate a clear ability of R. torques to liberate products from mucins, making them accessible to B. thetaiotaomicron . This work underscores the diversity of mucin-degrading mechanisms in different bacterial species and the probability that some species are contingent on others for the ability to more fully access mucin-derived nutrients. The ability of R. torques to directly degrade a variety of mucin and mucin glycan structures and unlock released glycans for other species suggests that it is a keystone mucin degrader, which might contribute to its association with IBD. IMPORTANCE An important facet of maintaining healthy symbiosis between host and intestinal microbes is the mucus layer, the first defense protecting the epithelium from lumenal bacteria. Some gut bacteria degrade the various components of intestinal mucins, but detailed mechanisms used by different species are still emerging. It is imperative to understand these mechanisms as they likely dictate interspecies interactions and may illuminate species associated with bacterial mucus damage and subsequent disease susceptibility. Ruminococcus torques is positively associated with IBD in multiple studies. We identified mucin glycan-degrading enzymes in R. torques and found that it shares mucin degradation products with another species of gut bacteria, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron . Our findings underscore the importance of understanding mucin degradation mechanisms in different gut bacteria and their consequences on interspecies interactions, which may identify keystone bacteria that disproportionately affect mucus damage and could therefore be key players in effects that result from reductions in mucus integrity.

- **Reasoning:** Review summarizes mucin‑degrading enzymes across gut microbes; no original R. gnavus experiments, growth assays, metabolic data, or controls are presented.","Abstract The gut microbiota interacts with the host through the mucus that covers and protects the gastrointestinal epithelium. The main component of the mucus are mucins, glycoproteins decorated with hundreds of different O-glycans. Some microbiota members can utilize mucin O-glycans as carbons source. To degrade these host glycans the bacteria express multiple carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) such as glycoside hydrolases, sulfatases and esterases which are active on specific linkages. The studies of these enzymes in an in vivo context have started to reveal their importance in mucin utilization and gut colonization. It is now clear that bacteria evolved multiple specific CAZymes to overcome the diversity of linkages found in O-glycans. Additionally, changes in mucin degradation by gut microbiota have been associated with diseases like obesity, diabetes, irritable bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Thereby understanding how CAZymes from different bacteria work to degrade mucins is of critical importance to develop new treatments and diagnostics for these increasingly prevalent health problems. This mini-review covers the recent advances in biochemical characterization of mucin O-glycan-degrading CAZymes and how they are connected to human health."

- **Reasoning:** Studies bacterial subpopulations producing extracellular glycosidases; no focus on R. gnavus, specific mucin growth assays, or detailed metabolic/ genetic analyses.","Recent work indicates that subpopulations of human fecal bacteria, averaging approximately 1% of the total viable fecal flora, degrade the oligosaccharide side chains of hog gastric mucin, which structurally resembles human epithelial mucins. Here we report studies to determine whether degradation of mucin oligosaccharides is related to glycosidase production by bacteria growing in anaerobic fecal cultures. Triplicate cultures containing hog gastric mucin were inoculated with serially diluted feces from each of seven healthy subjects. When the stationary growth phase was attained, mucin oligosaccharide degradation and both cell-bound and extracellular activities of four glycosidases were measured in each culture. Cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase were present in bacteria growing at all levels of fecal inocula, including 10(-11) g. In contrast, extracellular activities were present in every culture inoculated with 10(-4)-10(-7) g feces, but were diminished or absent in cultures inoculated with 10(-8)-10(-11) g feces. Bacterial autolysis was an unlikely cause of extracellular glycosidase activity, since p-nitrophenyl-alpha-l-fucosidase remained cell bound in cultures at every level of fecal inoculum. Degradation of mucin oligosaccharides was associated with extracellular, but not with cell-bound beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase. Among the seven subjects, the estimated most probable numbers (MPN) of fecal bacteria producing extracellular beta-d-galactosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and sialidase ranged from 10(6)-10(10)/g dry fecal wt, were comparable to the MPN of mucin-degrading bacteria, and were significantly smaller than the MPN of total fecal bacteria. We interpret these findings as evidence for the existence of bacterial subpopulations in the normal fecal flora that produce extracellular glycosidases, and that these subpopulations have a major role in degrading the complex oligosaccharides of mucin in the gut lumen."

However, its presence and role in the infant microbiota is not fully elucidated. This may due to the strictly anaerobic behavior of its members that hampers the possibility of culture-dependent enumeration. Here, we report on the presence of this bacterial group, using biomolecular techniques, in stool samples from 25 babies aged between one and 24 months. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used as a first detection step and data were confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The DGGE showed the presence of Lachnospiraceae in infant fecal specimens and indicated the prevalence of Ruminococcus gnavus (R. gnavus). The qPCR confirmed the presence of the Clostridium XVIa group, Blautia genus, and R. gnavus, which are the main members of this family. We detected R. gnavus in 22 of 25 (88%) samples with a qPCR probe assay. Despite the difficulties associated with their detection and enumeration, Lachnospiraceae, and in particular R. gnavus, should be included in future studies on the infant microbiota composition."

- **Reasoning:** Paper focuses on Bacteroidetes PUL models and laminarin/mucin predictions; no R. gnavus experiments, growth assays, or detailed mucin metabolism data.","Dietary fibers impact gut colonic health, through the production of short-chain fatty acids. A low-fiber diet has been linked to lower bacterial diversity, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and promotion of mucosal pathogens. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are important enzymes involved in the bacterial catabolism of fiber into short-chain fatty acids. However, the GH involved in glycan breakdown (adhesion, hydrolysis, and fermentation) are organized in polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) with complex modularity. Our goal was to explore how the capacity of strains, from the Bacteroidetes phylum, to grow on fiber could be predicted from their genome sequences. We designed an in silico pipeline called FiberGrowth and independently validated it for seven different fibers, on 28 genomes from Bacteroidetes-type strains. To do so, we compared the existing GH annotation tools and built PUL models by using published growth and gene expression data. FiberGrowth's prediction performance in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) strongly depended on available data and fiber: arabinoxylan (TPR: 0.89 and FPR: 0), inulin (0.95 and 0.33), heparin (0.8 and 0.22) laminarin (0.38 and 0.17), levan (0.3 and 0.06), mucus (0.13 and 0.38), and starch (0.73 and 0.41). Being able to better predict fiber breakdown by bacterial strains would help to understand their impact on human nutrition and health. Assuming further gene expression experiment along with discoveries on structural analysis, we hope computational tools like FiberGrowth will help researchers prioritize and design in vitro experiments."

To reproduce some of the nutritional and pH characteristics of the large gut, each vessel had a different operating volume (0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 liter) and pH (6.0, 6.5, and 7.0). A mixture of polysaccharides and proteins was used as carbon and nitrogen sources. Measurements of H2, CH4, S2-, sulfate reduction rates, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and volatile fatty acids were made throughout the experiment. After 48 days of running, porcine gastric mucin (5.8 g/day) was independently fed to vessel 1 of the multichamber system. The mucin was extensively degraded as evidenced by the stimulation of volatile fatty acid production. In the absence of mucin, sulfate-reducing activity was comparatively insignificant and methanogenesis was the major route for the disposal of electrons. The reverse occurred upon the addition of mucin; sulfate reduction predominated and methanogenesis was completely inhibited. This was attributed to release of sulfate from the mucin which enabled SRB to outcompete methanogenic bacteria for H2. SRB stimulated by mucin were acetate-utilizing Desulfobacter spp., lactate- and H2-utilizing Desulfovibrio spp., and propionate-utilizing Desulfobulbus spp. When the mucin pump was switched off, the multichamber system reverted to a state close to its original equilibrium. These data provide further evidence that sulfated polysaccharides such as mucin may be a source of sulfate for SRB in the human large gut."

Here we report studies characterising the saccharides released from hog gastric mucin during incubation with the extracellular enzymes in their cell-free culture supernates. We have also tested the ability of the saccharide products to support growth of larger populations of faecal bacteria. Gel exclusion chromatography of the residual mucin following bacterial growth in mucin-containing medium confirmed that MOD strains extensively degraded the carhohydrate moieties (60-96 per cent) whereas strains of bacteroides and bifidobacteria of larger faecal populations degraded the carbohydrate moieties less extensively (median loss, 29 per cent; range 8-42 per cent). Saccharides released from hog gastric niucin by MOD strain enzymes were identified by biochemical and NMR spectroscopic methods as galactose, fucose. N -acetylglucosamine. N -acetylgalactosamine and the disaccharides GalβGalNAc and Galβ3GlcNAc. Larger oligosaccharides were not recovered. Carbon-13 NMR spectra of the residual mucin were consistent with complete removal of some but not all oligosaccliaride chains. The monosaccharides but not the disaccharides were also recovered following incubation of mucin with the sterile cell-free supernate of a heavily inoculated faecal culture. Saccharides released from hog gastric mucin by partially purified culture supernate enzyincs from Ruminococcus torques strain IX-70 were 70-98 per cent utilised by larger populations of faecal bacteria during growth in culture. Bacteria growing from 1 x 10 -10 g faecal inocula from five subjects showed minimal growth in media containing intact hog gastric mucin but grew well if the mucin-containing medium was preincubated with a sterile enzyme preparation from R. torques IX-70. We conclude that glycosidases produced by MOD strains can serve a nutritionally supportive role for larger populations of enteric bacteria, especially during fasting.

Some of these mucosal residents thrive on mucin glycoproteins that make up this layer. Mucin glycan degraders release mono- and oligosaccharides, and produce metabolites and gases that can be used by other inhabitants of the mucus layer through cross-feeding. In this thesis, I studied the collective mucin glycan degradation by a network of interacting microbes. To do that, I created a microbial mucin-degrading synthetic community (MDSC) and studied its composition and function during growth on mucin. This revealed that all mucin glycan degraders could co-exist, and that they could sustain butyrate-producing and hydrogen-consuming organisms. I show that a large number of diverse glycan-degrading enzymes encoded by different bacteria is involved in mucin glycan degradation. Throughout this thesis, specialist mucin glycan degrader Akkermansia muciniphila played a central role. When present from the start in a synthetic community growing on mucin, it was the dominant organism. Even when it was added after stabilisation of the synthetic community, to simulate probiotic treatment, A. muciniphila was able to colonise and persist. Furthermore, in a synthetic community that was designed to model the developing infant gut microbiota, the mucin specificity of A. muciniphila was again confirmed, as it only grew in the presence of mucin and not with any of the other substrates. A comparison of A. muciniphila to fellow specialist mucin glycan degrader Ruminococcus torques and glycan generalist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron revealed that each mucin glycan degrader has distinct preferences for specific mucin glycan structures. Consequently, growing the synthetic community on different mucin types affected community composition and function. This thesis demonstrates the utility of synthetic communities for microbial ecophysiological research, and contributes another piece to the puzzle of the ecological interactions that occur between the microbes that call the mucus layer their home.

Colonic mucus consists of a loose outer layer and a dense epithelium-attached layer. The outer layer is inhabited by various representatives of the human gut microbiota (HGM). Glycans of the colonic mucus can be used by the HGM as a source of carbon and energy when dietary fibers are not sufficiently available. Here, we analyzed 397 individual HGM genomes to identify pathways for the cleavage of host-synthetized mucin glycans to monosaccharides as well as for the catabolism of the derived monosaccharides. Our key results are as follows: (i) Genes for the cleavage of mucin glycans were found in 86% of the analyzed genomes, whereas genes for the catabolism of derived monosaccharides were found in 89% of the analyzed genomes. (ii) Comparative genomic analysis identified four alternative forms of the monosaccharide-catabolizing enzymes and four alternative forms of monosaccharide transporters. (iii) Eighty-five percent of the analyzed genomes may be involved in exchange pathways for the monosaccharides derived from cleaved mucin glycans. (iv) The analyzed genomes demonstrated different abilities to degrade known mucin glycans. Generally, the ability to degrade at least one type of mucin glycan was predicted for 81% of the analyzed genomes. (v) Eighty-two percent of the analyzed genomes can form mutualistic pairs that are able to degrade mucin glycans and are not degradable by any of the paired organisms alone.

- **Reasoning:** Studies mucin-degrading commensals other than R. gnavus; no R. gnavus mucin experiments, so not relevant to any criteria.","The intestinal epithelium surface is covered by a layer of mucus that harbors a complex and dynamic population of bacteria termed gut microbiota. In particular, some gut bacteria have the ability to degrade the mucin glycan for nutritional sources. However, the bacterial diversity of mucin-degrading bacteria in human gut microbiota and their role in the gut remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the diversity of mucin-degrading bacteria in the human gut microbiota by an established cultivation-based molecular profiling method. The results showed the gut commensals having the mucin degrading ability were widely distributed in the gut microbiota and were more abundant than previously thought. In addition, many previously uncharacterized mucin degraders were isolated from faecals samples, suggesting the mucin-degrading gut commensals were underappreciated. To gain a better understanding of the interaction between these mucin-degrading gut commensals and the host, the effect of the commensals on intestinal epithelial cells were examined, and the results revealed that the commensals (8 Bacteroides spp., 2 Parabacteroides spp, Akkermanisa muciniphila and Bifidobacterial dentium) incited low level of inflammatory response (IL-8 and TNF-α) but suppressed the inflammatory response induced by E. coli through downregulating the NF-κB pathway. The presence of gut commensals also showed potential in enhancing the epithelial tight junction (TJ) barrier function through regulating the mRNA expression of TJ protein genes such as Zo-1, Occludin, Claudin-1 and E-cadherin. Furthermore, the presence of commensal bacteria P. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron and A. muciniphila completely or partly restored the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β induced TJ barrier disruption. In conclusion, these findings indicate that mucin-degrading gut commensals were widely distributed in the gut microbiota and showed anti-inflammatory effect against pathogen infection and potential in modulating the epithelial barrier function."

- **Reasoning:** Review article lists R. gnavus as a mucin‑degrader but provides no primary experiments, growth assays, metabolic data, or controls specific to R. gnavus mucin utilization.","The human gut is colonized by a variety of large amounts of microbes that are collectively called intestinal microbiota. Most of these microbial residents will grow within the mucus layer that overlies the gut epithelium and will act as the first line of defense against both commensal and invading microbes. This mucus is essentially formed by mucins, a family of highly glycosylated protein that are secreted by specialize cells in the gut. In this Review, we examine how commensal members of the microbiota and pathogenic bacteria use mucus to their advantage to promote their growth, develop biofilms and colonize the intestine. We also discuss how mucus-derived components act as nutrient and chemical cues for adaptation and pathogenesis of bacteria and how bacteria can influence the composition of the mucus layer."

- **Reasoning:** Paper reviews O‑mucin‑degrading CAZymes across many gut microbes; mentions R. gnavus as a mucin degrader but provides no direct R. gnavus experiments, growth assays, or metabolic data.","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are modern diseases, with incidence rising around the world. They are associated with perturbation of the intestinal microbiota, and with alteration and crossing of the mucus barrier by the commensal bacteria that feed on it. In the process of mucus catabolism and invasion by gut bacteria, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play a critical role since mucus is mainly made up by O- and N-glycans. Moreover, the occurrence of IBD seems to be associated with low-fiber diets. Conversely, supplementation with oligosaccharides, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are structurally similar to intestinal mucins and could thus compete with them towards bacterial mucus-degrading CAZymes, has been suggested to prevent inflammation. In this mini-review, we will establish the current state of knowledge regarding the identification and characterization of mucus-degrading enzymes from both cultured and uncultured species of gut commensals and enteropathogens, with a particular focus on the present technological opportunities available to further the discovery of mucus-degrading CAZymes within the entire gut microbiome, by coupling microfluidics with metagenomics and culturomics. Finally, we will discuss the challenges to overcome to better assess how CAZymes targeting specific functional oligosaccharides could be involved in the modulation of the mucus-driven cross-talk between gut bacteria and their host in the context of IBD.

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on Ruminococcus albus fiber degradation and ethanol production; no mucin, R. gnavus, or relevant assays presented.","Bacteria in the genus Ruminococcus are ubiquitous members of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. In particular, they are important in ruminants where they digest a wide range of plant cell wall polysaccharides. For example, Ruminococcus albus 7 is a primary cellulose degrader that produces acetate usable by its bovine host. Moreover, it is one of the few organisms that ferments cellulose to form ethanol at mesophilic temperatures in vitro. The mechanism of cellulose degradation by R. albus 7 is not well-defined and is thought to involve pilin-like proteins, unique carbohydrate-binding domains, a glycocalyx, and cellulosomes. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics, fermentation analyses, and transcriptomics to further clarify the cellulolytic and fermentative potential of R. albus 7. A comparison of the R. albus 7 genome sequence against the genome sequences of related bacteria that either encode or do not encode cellulosomes revealed that R. albus 7 does not encode for most canonical cellulosomal components. Fermentation analysis of R. albus 7 revealed the ability to produce ethanol and acetate on a wide range of fibrous substrates in vitro. Global transcriptomic analysis of R. albus 7 grown at identical dilution rates on cellulose and cellobiose in a chemostat showed that this bacterium, when growing on cellulose, utilizes a carbohydrate-degrading strategy that involves increased transcription of the rare carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) family 37 domain and the tryptophan biosynthetic operon. Our data suggest that R. albus 7 does not use canonical cellulosomal components to degrade cellulose, but rather up-regulates the expression of CBM37-containing enzymes and tryptophan biosynthesis. This study contributes to a revised model of carbohydrate degradation by this key member of the rumen ecosystem."

- **Reasoning:** Focuses on antimicrobial properties of mucus and biomedical applications, without any experiments involving Ruminococcus gnavus or its mucin metabolism.","Mucus layers often provide a unique and multi-functional hydrogel interface between the epithelial cells of organisms and their external environment. Mucus has exceptional properties including elasticity, changeable rheology and an ability to self-repair by re-annealing, and is therefore an ideal medium for trapping and immobilising pathogens and serving as a barrier to microbial infection. The ability to produce a functional surface mucosa was an important evolutionary step, which evolved first in the Cnidaria, which includes corals, and the Ctenophora. This allowed the exclusion of non-commensal microbes and the subsequent development of the mucus-lined digestive cavity seen in higher metazoans. The fundamental architecture of the constituent glycoprotein mucins is also evolutionarily conserved. Although an understanding of the biochemical interactions between bacteria and the mucus layer are important to the goal of developing new antimicrobial strategies, they remain relatively poorly understood. This review summarises the physicochemical properties and evolutionary importance of mucus, which make it so successful in the prevention of bacterial infection. In addition, the strategies developed by bacteria to counteract the mucus layer are also explored."

The present study was undertaken to determine the dif- ferential fate of the various types of mucins. Mucins from germ-free rats were incubated in vitro in the presence of whole caecal flora from the conventional rat. Neutral, acidic and acidic sulphated mucins were spectrophotometrically assayed over time upon anaerobic incubation. Sialylated mucins were more rapidly degraded (90 %) than the other two types after 1 h and almost completely within 4 h. Neutral and acidic sulphated mucins, with a 10-fold and 30-fold lower content than the sialylated fraction in the original substrate, were more slowly degraded and to a lesser extent within 4 h, (55 and 40 %, respectively). The method used in the present study made it possible to investigate the activity of gut bacteria towards the various types of mucins. The degradation of the three mucin types was not uniform, the highest rate and extent of degradation being observed for sialylated mucins. @ Inra/Elsevier, Paris"

- **Reasoning:** The paper investigates temperate bacteriophages infecting R. gnavus and does not address mucin utilization, growth assays, metabolic profiling, or related experimental controls.","ABSTRACT Ruminococcus gnavus is a prevalent gut microbe reported to occur in higher abundance among individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study reports the isolation and characterization of six bacteriophages (phages) isolated from human fecal material and environmental samples that infect this species. Isolated phages have a siphovirus morphology, with genomes ranging between 36.5 and 37.8 kbp. Genome analysis indicates that the phages have a temperate lifestyle, which was confirmed by their ability to form lysogens on their host bacterial species. In contrast to the finding that phages lyse their host in liquid medium, results from a mouse trial indicate these phages can co-exist with the host bacterium in the gut without causing a significant reduction of R. gnavus. The bacterial counts in the feces of phage-treated mice did not significantly differ in the presence of phage. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available gut virome sequence data indicates a high abundance of these phages among individuals suffering from IBD. This work provides the first insight into how phages interact with R. gnavus in the human gut microbiome."
