You have a simple language mode in your pockets: the keyboard of your mobile phone is programmed to suggest some possible words
when you type a message.

This model is called [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) and it's trained on real texts, but just using a limited window (for example 3 words, in a 3-gram)
and associates frequencies of observed triplets.

With two new papers, Anthropic's researchers have taken significant steps towards understanding the circuits that underlie an AI modelâ€™s thoughts.
