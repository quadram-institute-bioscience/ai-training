## Limitations of LLMs

While Large Language Models are powerful tools, they have significant limitations that users must understand to use them effectively and responsibly.

Consider this prompt and try to answer yourself:
![A prompt]({% link img/5-prompt.png %})


This is the answer that an old version of ChatGPT gave:
![A solution (wrong)]({% link img/5-gpt.png %})


#### Why is that?

Let's focus on a key aspect: LLMs are trained on a vast amount of text. Including this common HR riddle:

> Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. **They have only one flashlight and the bridge can only hold two people at a time.** 
The four people walk at different speeds: one can cross the bridge in 1 minute, another in 2 minutes, the third in 5 minutes, and the slowest in 10 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must go at the slower personâ€™s pace. The speed of two people crossing a bridge together is limited by the speed of the slower person.

:bulb: LLMs are very confident token stirrers.
