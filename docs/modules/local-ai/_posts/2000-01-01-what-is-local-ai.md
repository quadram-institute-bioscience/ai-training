## What is Local AI?

Local AI refers to running artificial intelligence models directly on your own device rather than using cloud-based services. 
This approach offers unique advantages for privacy, control, and customization.

* :lock: Nothing leaves your computer
* :loop: You can build **customized workflows** (for example calling AI from Python scripts)
* :open_file_folder: **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** using your local documents

### Key Concepts

#### Cloud AI vs. Local AI

**Cloud AI:** (ChatGPT, Claude etc...)

- Models run on remote servers
- Requires internet connection
- Data sent to external services (some countries like the USA allow authorities to ask access to the logs)
- Generally more powerful models
- Pay-per-use or subscription pricing

**Local AI:**
- Models run on your device (CPU/GPU)
- Works offline
- Data stays on your machine
- Limited by hardware capabilities (large model require high-spec computers)
- One-time setup cost

:bulb: Apple computers now feature a chip (Apple Silicon) with a relatively powerful GPU, that can run reasonably large models if there is enough memory available.
