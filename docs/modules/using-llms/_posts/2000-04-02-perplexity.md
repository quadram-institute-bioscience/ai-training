## Advanced uses

Perplexity has the ambition of being more accurate than others by providing *sources* for its output. 
See an [**example answer**]({% link examples/perplexity/ex1.md %}).

In this page we will explore three specialised uses of Perplexity:

1. Research
2. Labs

If you check the perplexity form:

![screenshot]({{ '/img/perplexity.png' | relative_url }})

there are two buttons at the bottom, one for **research** and one for **labs**.


### :one: Research tasks

This is used to retrieve multiple documents (sources) related to your query. 
This means your query will be expanded and the output more comprehensive.

### :two: Labs

This is to generate files. This could be
* coding
* project management
* creative output
