## Advanced uses

In this page we will explore three specialised uses of ChatGPT:

1. Image generation
2. Explorative data analysis
3. Custom GPTs


### Image generation

The icon for this website was generated by ChatGPT with a simple prompt, where I injected the colors used by QIB logo:

```text
Generate a FAVICON for a website about learning AI.
Simple and clear even at short size.
Should be squared and use this palette 
 --antiflash-white: #F0F1F1ff;
 --apple-green: #B6BE00ff;
 --pine-green: #097E74ff;
 --charcoal: #2F3D46ff;
```

The initial result was:

<img src="{{ '/examples/images/gpt-favicon.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Favicon logo GPT generated" style="width: 200px">
