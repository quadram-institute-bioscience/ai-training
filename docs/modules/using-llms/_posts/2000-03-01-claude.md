## Advanced uses

In this page we will explore three specialised uses of Claude:

1. Vector Image generation
2. Projects
3. HTML Page generation


### :one: Image generation

Unlike ChatGPT, Claude cannot generate bitmap images (like photos), but can try to make vector images.

### :two: Projects

Most chatbots (ChatGPT, Perplexity, and of course... Claude!) support "projects". In a project you can add some
generic instructions that will be applied to all the queries, and also upload a set of documents that will be used as 
"project knowledge" while preparing your answers.

For example for a coding task (code here) I made a project where I uploaded some PDF with the format specifications.

### :three: Create an HTML page 

HTML is the language used to create web pages. Using another language called JavaScript, we can add some 
"interactivity" to the page.

For example, we can make a single page application to reverse complement DNA sequences. This is my prompt:

```
Generate a single page HTML application to reverse complement DNA sequences. 

THE INTERFACE
A top bar with the program title "DNA RevCompl")
Upper part, underneath the top bar: 
place a nice text box where the user will paste or type their DNA sequence(s).
The input can be a naked DNA string or a FASTA or multi FASTA text with headers.
(only multi FASTA will be considered multiple sequences, 
if naked DNA, ignore newlines and consider it  a single sequence)
Bottom part: the output section, divided in left list of sequences
(user can select one at the time to see its output) 
and a main part with the reverse complement of the selected sequence.

THE PROGRAM
Reverse and complement each DNA sequence received.
It should be IUPAC DNA aware 
(reverse complement also degenerate bases like W, R...)

Ask me questions if the prompt is unclear
```

This are some outputs (Claude did well):
* [Claude Output (1 shot)]({{ '/examples/revcompl/revcompl_claude.html' | relative_url }})
* [ChatGPT Output (1 shot)]({{ '/examples/revcompl/revcompl_openai.html' | relative_url }})
* [Deepseek 70b via Ollama (local)s]({{ '/examples/revcompl/revcompl_ollama_70b_2.html' | relative_url }})
