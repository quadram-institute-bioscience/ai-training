## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to get the best possible outputs from Large Language Models.

### What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves:
- **Crafting Instructions**: Writing clear, specific directions
- **Providing Context**: Including relevant background information
- **Structuring Input**: Organizing information effectively
- **Iterating and Refining**: Improving prompts based on results

### Core Principles

#### Clarity and Specificity
```
❌ Poor: "Write about dogs"
✅ Good: "Write a 300-word informative article about golden retriever training techniques for new dog owners"
```

#### Context Provision
```
❌ Poor: "Translate this"
✅ Good: "Translate this marketing email from English to Spanish, maintaining a professional but friendly tone"
```

#### Task Decomposition
```
❌ Poor: "Analyze this data and give recommendations"
✅ Good: "First, summarize the key trends in this sales data. Then, identify the top 3 performance issues. Finally, suggest specific action items for each issue."
```

### Essential Techniques

#### 1. Role Playing
Assign the AI a specific role or persona:

```
"You are an experienced software engineer. Review this code and suggest improvements for performance and readability."

"Act as a patient teacher explaining quantum physics to a high school student."
```

#### 2. Few-Shot Learning
Provide examples of desired input-output pairs:

```
Classify these emails as spam or not spam:

Email: "Congratulations! You've won $1,000,000!"
Classification: Spam

Email: "Meeting moved to 3 PM tomorrow"
Classification: Not Spam

Email: "Click here for amazing weight loss secrets!"
Classification: ?
```

#### 3. Chain of Thought
Guide the model through step-by-step reasoning:

```
"Solve this math problem step by step:
What is 15% of 240?

Step 1: Convert percentage to decimal
Step 2: Multiply the number by the decimal
Step 3: Show the final answer"
```

#### 4. Output Formatting
Specify exactly how you want the response structured:

```
"Analyze this product review and provide:
1. Overall sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
2. Key themes (max 3)
3. Specific issues mentioned
4. Recommended actions

Format as JSON with these exact keys."
```

### Advanced Techniques

#### Tree of Thoughts
Explore multiple reasoning paths:

```
"Consider three different approaches to solve this problem:
Approach 1: [method]
Approach 2: [method]
Approach 3: [method]

Evaluate each approach and recommend the best one."
```

#### Constitutional AI Prompting
Include principles and values:

```
"Provide advice on this ethical dilemma. Consider:
- Respect for individual autonomy
- Minimizing harm to all parties
- Fairness and justice
- Long-term consequences"
```

#### Negative Prompting
Explicitly state what to avoid:

```
"Write a product description that:
- Highlights key features
- Uses simple language
- Avoids technical jargon
- Does not make exaggerated claims
- Is under 100 words"
```

### Prompt Structure Templates

#### Basic Structure
```
[ROLE] You are a [specific role]
[CONTEXT] Given this context: [background information]
[TASK] Your task is to: [specific instruction]
[FORMAT] Provide the output in this format: [format specification]
[CONSTRAINTS] Requirements: [limitations and guidelines]
```

#### Analysis Template
```
"Analyze the following [content type]:

[CONTENT]

Provide:
1. Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key insights (3-5 bullet points)
3. Recommendations (specific actions)
4. Potential concerns or limitations

Focus on [specific aspect] and consider [context]."
```

#### Creative Writing Template
```
"Write a [content type] that:
- Genre: [specify genre]
- Audience: [target audience]
- Tone: [desired tone]
- Length: [word count]
- Key elements to include: [list]
- Style: [writing style preference]"
```

### Common Prompt Patterns

#### Question-Answer Format
```
"Answer these questions about [topic]:
Q1: What is [specific aspect]?
Q2: How does [process] work?
Q3: What are the benefits of [approach]?
Q4: What challenges might arise?"
```

#### Comparison Format
```
"Compare [Option A] and [Option B] across these dimensions:
- Cost
- Performance
- Ease of use
- Scalability
- Support

Provide a recommendation based on [specific criteria]."
```

#### Problem-Solution Format
```
"Given this problem: [problem description]

1. Identify root causes
2. Brainstorm potential solutions
3. Evaluate each solution
4. Recommend the best approach
5. Outline implementation steps"
```

### Optimization Strategies

#### A/B Testing Prompts
- Create multiple versions of the same prompt
- Test different phrasings and structures
- Compare output quality and consistency
- Keep successful patterns

#### Iterative Refinement
1. **Start Simple**: Basic version of your prompt
2. **Analyze Output**: Identify weaknesses or missing elements
3. **Refine**: Add specificity, examples, or constraints
4. **Test Again**: Evaluate improved results
5. **Repeat**: Continue until satisfied

#### Prompt Chaining
Break complex tasks into smaller prompts:

```
Prompt 1: "Extract key facts from this document"
Prompt 2: "Using these facts, identify main themes"
Prompt 3: "Based on the themes, write a summary"
```

### Domain-Specific Prompting

#### Code Generation
```
"Write a Python function that:
- Function name: calculate_compound_interest
- Parameters: principal, rate, time, compound_frequency
- Returns: final amount
- Include: type hints, docstring, error handling
- Style: Follow PEP 8 conventions"
```

#### Data Analysis
```
"Analyze this dataset:
[DATA]

1. Identify data types and structure
2. Find patterns and trends
3. Detect outliers or anomalies
4. Suggest visualization approaches
5. Recommend next analysis steps"
```

#### Content Marketing
```
"Create a social media post for [platform]:
- Product: [product name]
- Audience: [target demographic]
- Goal: [engagement/awareness/conversion]
- Tone: [brand voice]
- Include: relevant hashtags and call-to-action
- Length: [character limit]"
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Vague or Generic Responses
**Problem**: Output lacks specificity
**Solution**: Add more context, examples, and constraints

#### Inconsistent Results
**Problem**: Different outputs for same prompt
**Solution**: Lower temperature, add more structure, use examples

#### Off-topic Responses
**Problem**: Model doesn't follow instructions
**Solution**: Clearer task definition, explicit constraints, role specification

#### Incomplete Answers
**Problem**: Missing important aspects
**Solution**: Explicitly list required components, use numbered structure

### Best Practices Checklist

✅ **Be Specific**: Use precise language and clear instructions
✅ **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
✅ **Use Examples**: Show desired input-output patterns
✅ **Structure Output**: Specify format and organization
✅ **Set Constraints**: Define limits and requirements
✅ **Test and Iterate**: Refine based on results
✅ **Document Success**: Save effective prompts for reuse
✅ **Verify Results**: Check outputs for accuracy and relevance
