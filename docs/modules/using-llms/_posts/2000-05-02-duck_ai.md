The search engine "DuckDuckGo" has a focus on privacy.

It now features an [AI chatbot](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=DuckDuckGo+AI+Chat&ia=chat&duckai=1&atb=v431-1), a free feature that allows you to have private conversations with 3rd-party AI chat models, anonymized by us. It currently supports Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Haiku, Meta’s Llama 4 Scout, Mistral AI’s Mistral Small 3 24B, and OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini. 

The focus is to provide a more private use, as it does not record or store any of your chats, and your conversations are not used to train chat models by DuckDuckGo or the underlying model providers (for example, Open AI and Anthropic).

Duck.ai can save up to 30 of your recent conversations so you can refer to them later. To protect your privacy, these chats are stored locally on your device, not on DuckDuckGo or other remote servers. You can opt out of recent chats at any time in Duck.ai settings.
