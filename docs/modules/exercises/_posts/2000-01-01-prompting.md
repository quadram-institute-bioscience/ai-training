Analyze the sentiment of these customer reviews:

Review: "The product arrived quickly and works perfectly!"
Sentiment: Positive
Reason: Expresses satisfaction with delivery and product quality

Review: "Terrible customer service, never buying again."
Sentiment: Negative  
Reason: Expresses frustration and intention to stop purchasing

Review: "It's okay, nothing special but does the job."
Sentiment: Neutral
Reason: Lukewarm assessment without strong positive or negative feelings

Now analyze this review:
Review: "Great value for money, though the packaging could be better."
Sentiment: ?
Reason: ?
```
