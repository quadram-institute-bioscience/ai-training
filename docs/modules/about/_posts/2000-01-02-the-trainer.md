## The Trainer

Welcome to the course! 
I'm Andrea Telatin, Head of Bioinformatics at the [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://www.quadram.ac.uk).

I am a molecular biologist by training, and during my PhD I specialised in bioinformatics applied to Next-Generation Sequencing.

After working for 4 years for a sequencing company in Italy, I moved to the UK joining the core bioinformatics team of the Quadram Institute.
Here I did a lot of [bioinformatics training](https://www.telatin.com/bioinformatics/microbiome-bioinformatics/index.html),
including this entry level overview of LLMs :smile:
