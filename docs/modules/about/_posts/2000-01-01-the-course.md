## The Course

<img src="{% link  /examples/images/gpt-favicon.png %}" width="20%" style="float: right;">
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) and their practical applications. 
You'll learn about the fundamentals of machine learning, focusing on why LLMs are not intelligent and can confidently 
generate wrong information (but in a nice English!).
At the same time, with some pre-cautions, we can benefit from language models, and even explore how to run some (smaller)
model **locally** (in your computer, without sending any data to third parties).

| 1   | Critically evaluate LLM outputs by identifying potential hallucinations, biases, and knowledge limitations      |
| 2   | Make informed decisions about data privacy, academic integrity, and appropriate use of AI in scholarly work     |
| 3   | Select appropriate deployment models (local vs. cloud) based on data sensitivity and privacy requirements       |
| 4   | Effectively prompt and utilize generative AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity) for research-appropriate tasks |
| 5   | Utilise literature mining AI-powered tools (such as Elicit) and understand their limitations                    |
