title: Agents (Web)
---

An interesting operational mode is offered by ChatGPT Codex, in having access to your repositories and running entirely on the cloud
to improve the code and then opening a "Pull Request" to your repository.

The web interface looks like a chatbot, but you have to specify the repository you will work on (in this example `covtobed`):

![Codex]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link img/codex1.png %})

After working on your request, the agent can create a "pull request" to your repository on your behalf:

![PR by Codex]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link img/codex.png %})

### Copilot (GitHub)

Microsoft added copilot features in GitHub (not without sparking a good level of controversy).
When a GitHub action fails, Copilot can quickly check the log to explain it:

![Copilot debug]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link img/copilot-github.png %})

In this case I made an error in this very website's syntax and quickly found where it originated.
