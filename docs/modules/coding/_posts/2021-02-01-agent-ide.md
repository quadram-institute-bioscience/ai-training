title: Agents (IDE)
---

Agents can orchestrate several tasks and typially will work inside an entire code project (folder),
either in your computer (a local directory) or remotely using a Github repository.

IDE (integrated developing environments) are powerful text editors, the most famous being 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Thanks to plug-ins like:
* Copilot
* Claude Code
* ChatGPT...

They can add an "assistant". 

There are dedicated IDEs (derived from VS Code) that have an AI-first approach:

* [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)
* [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/blog/introducing-google-antigravity)

At the time of writing Antigravity is free to use altough with limited usage of the LLMs, and can be a good first attempt 
if you didnt try a coding agent.

In the right pane you can ask to your agent the desired changes to your code and this will make a plan and start implementing 
the items in the "to do" list.

The assistants can execute code in your machine and evaluate the output to make decisions (e.g. running a command and seeing the error to debug it)
