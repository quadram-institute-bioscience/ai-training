Try: "How do different carbon reduction strategies compare in terms of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact?"
```

**SciSpace Copilot Queries:**
```
Effective queries:
- "What methodology did this study use to measure [specific variable]?"
- "How does this finding compare to [specific other study]?"
- "What are the limitations mentioned by the authors?"
- "What future research directions are suggested?"
```

#### Automation Strategies
