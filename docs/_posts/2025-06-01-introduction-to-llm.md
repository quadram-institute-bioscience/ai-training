| 1   | Critically evaluate LLM outputs by identifying potential hallucinations, biases, and knowledge limitations      |
| 2   | Make informed decisions about data privacy, academic integrity, and appropriate use of AI in scholarly work     |
| 3   | Select appropriate deployment models (local vs. cloud) based on data sensitivity and privacy requirements       |
| 4   | Effectively prompt and utilize generative AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity) for research-appropriate tasks |
| 5   | Utilise literature mining AI-powered tools (such as Elicit) and understand their limitations                    |
| 6   | Leverage coding assistants to generate, debug, and optimize code for research tasks                             |
