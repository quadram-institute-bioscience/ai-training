## Introduction {#introduction}

Welcome to AI Training Hub! This platform is dedicated to exploring the cutting-edge world of artificial intelligence training methodologies. Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or curious enthusiast, you'll find comprehensive guides on modern AI training techniques.

From foundational concepts like gradient descent to advanced methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we cover the full spectrum of AI training approaches. Our content bridges theory and practice, helping you understand not just *what* works, but *why* it works.

> "The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight." - Modern AI training transforms raw data into intelligent behavior through carefully designed learning algorithms.

## Training Fundamentals {#training-fundamentals}

Essential concepts every AI practitioner should master:

- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled datasets for classification and regression
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data through clustering and dimensionality reduction  
- **Loss Functions**: Quantifying model performance and guiding optimization
- **Gradient Descent**: The backbone algorithm for neural network parameter updates
- **Regularization**: Preventing overfitting through techniques like dropout and weight decay
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and augmenting training data

Here's a simple gradient descent implementation:

```python
# Basic gradient descent optimizer
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=1000):
    """
    Implements basic gradient descent for linear regression
    X: input features, y: target values
    """
    # Initialize weights randomly
    weights = np.random.randn(X.shape[1])
    bias = 0
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Forward pass: compute predictions
        predictions = X.dot(weights) + bias
        
        # Compute loss (mean squared error)
        loss = np.mean((predictions - y) ** 2)
        
        # Compute gradients
        dw = (2/len(y)) * X.T.dot(predictions - y)
        db = (2/len(y)) * np.sum(predictions - y)
        
        # Update parameters
        weights -= learning_rate * dw
        bias -= learning_rate * db
        
        if epoch % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
    
    return weights, bias
```

Modern transformer training with PyTorch:

```python
# Transformer training loop with mixed precision
import torch
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast

def train_transformer(model, dataloader, optimizer, epochs=10):
    """
    Training loop for transformer models with automatic mixed precision
    """
    scaler = GradScaler()  # For mixed precision training
    model.train()
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        
        for batch_idx, (input_ids, labels) in enumerate(dataloader):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Use autocast for mixed precision
            with autocast():
                outputs = model(input_ids)
                loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(outputs.logits, labels)
            
            # Backward pass with gradient scaling
            scaler.scale(loss).backward()
            scaler.step(optimizer)
            scaler.update()
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
            
            if batch_idx % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Batch {batch_idx}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch} completed. Average Loss: {total_loss/len(dataloader):.4f}")
```
