This is a companion site for the course Introduction to LLMs for the Norwich Biosciences Institutes.

It's a 2 hours walk-through roughly developed upon this by this *6 minutes* presentation:

The core idea is understanding that LLMs are not intelligent, but overpowered **stochastic parrots** that can be used to generate text, code, and even images, but they can also confidently generate wrong information (but in a nice English!).

Ethical use of AI and privacy concerns are also discussed, with a focus on how to use AI responsibly in research.

The topics discussed include:

* [A simple introduction to Machine Learning and basic principles of LLMs]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link modules/intro/_posts/2000-01-01-what-is-machine-learning.md %})
* [Some practical tips on using LLM chatbots (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity)]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link modules/using-llms/_posts/2000-02-01-chatgpt.md %})
* [How we can run some LLMs locally (in your computer, without sending any data to third parties)]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link modules/local-ai/_posts/2000-01-01-what-is-local-ai.md %})
* [Literature mining specific tools: what works and what doesn't]({{ site.baseurl }}/{% link modules/literature/_posts/2000-01-01-overview.md %})
