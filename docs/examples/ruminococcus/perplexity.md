# Can *Ruminococcus gnavus* use mucin as a carbon source?

Yes. *Ruminococcus gnavus* is a mucin‑degrading gut symbiont, and multiple studies show that many strains can grow with purified mucin as the main or sole added carbon source. However, **this ability is strongly strain‑dependent**: some strains (e.g. ATCC 29149, ATCC 35913 and most clinical isolates tested) grow on mucin, whereas others (e.g. E1) cannot unless given additional mucin-degrading activities.

Below is a list of primary papers where *R. gnavus* mucin utilization was tested experimentally, focusing on actual growth assays with mucin substrates.

## Key experimental evidence (growth on mucin)

| Study | Strains | Mucin substrate / condition | Evidence for mucin use as carbon source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hoskins et al., JCI 1985 “Mucin degradation in human colon ecosystems. Isolation and properties of fecal strains that degrade hog gastric mucin oligosaccharide chains” [Ruminococcus AB VI‑268] | Ruminococcus AB strain VI‑268 (later reclassified as *R. gnavus* ATCC 35913) | Hog gastric mucin (HGM); selection medium where mucin oligosaccharide side chains were the **sole carbohydrate source** [^1_1][^1_2] | VI‑268 released hexoses from HGM during growth in culture and degraded blood‑group B epitopes; hexose loss from HGM and increased cell density demonstrate growth supported by mucin glycans as carbon source[^1_1][^1_2]. |
| Crost et al., PLOS ONE 2013 “Utilisation of mucin glycans by the human gut symbiont *Ruminococcus gnavus* is strain‑dependent” | ATCC 29149, E1 | YCFA basal medium with 1% purified porcine gastric mucin (pPGM) as **sole added carbon source**; plus individual mucin monosaccharides[^1_3][^1_4][^1_5] | Both strains assimilated mucin monosaccharides, but **only ATCC 29149 grew on pPGM as sole carbon source**; E1 did not grow. Established strain‑specific mucin utilisation[^1_3][^1_4][^1_5]. |
| Tailford et al., Nat Commun 2015 “Discovery of intramolecular trans‑sialidases in human gut microbiota…” | ATCC 29149, E1 | Mucin and 3′‑sialyllactose as inducers; same strains as Crost 2013[^1_6] | Recaps and extends Crost 2013: ATCC 29149 encodes a Nan sialic‑acid catabolism cluster and an intramolecular trans‑sialidase (NanH) induced when cells are grown on 3′‑sialyllactose or mucin; **E1 lacks this cluster and “is unable to grow on mucin as a sole carbon source”**[^1_6]. Links mucin growth to sialic‑acid metabolism. |
| Crost et al., Gut Microbes 2016 “The mucin‑degradation strategy of *Ruminococcus gnavus*” | ATCC 29149, ATCC 35913 | YCFA + 1% purified porcine gastric mucin (pPGM) as **sole added carbon source**[^1_7][^1_8][^1_9] | Showed that **both ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 grow on pPGM**, whereas E1 does not. RNA‑seq showed Nan (sialic acid) cluster, IT‑sialidase and fucosidase genes strongly upregulated when grown on mucin vs glucose, confirming active use of terminal mucin glycans as carbon source[^1_7][^1_8][^1_9]. Both strains also grew on 2,7‑anhydro‑Neu5Ac as sole carbon source[^1_7][^1_8]. |
| Crost et al., Front Microbiol 2018 “Mechanistic insights into the cross‑feeding of *R. gnavus* and *R. bromii*…” | ATCC 29149 | YCFA + 1% pPGM or starch as **sole carbon source**[^1_10] | In mono‑culture, **ATCC 29149 grew on mucin but not on starch**; *R. bromii* grew on starch but not mucin. In mucin cultures, *R. bromii* did not benefit from *R. gnavus* activity, confirming that *R. gnavus* alone utilises mucin glycoproteins as an energy source[^1_10]. |
| Png et al., Am J Gastroenterol 2010 “Mucolytic bacteria with increased prevalence in IBD mucosa augment in vitro utilization of mucin by other bacteria” | Clinical *R. gnavus* and *R. torques* isolates | Purified human secretory MUC2 mucin; anaerobic cultures; assays of mucin degradation[^1_11] | Defined “mucolytic bacteria” by ability to **degrade human MUC2 in pure culture**; *R. gnavus* isolates were among mucolytic strains increased in IBD mucosa[^1_11]. While not a detailed growth‑curve paper, the definition requires that *R. gnavus* grows while degrading MUC2-derived glycans as nutrient. |
| Henke et al., PNAS 2019 “*Ruminococcus gnavus*, a member of the human gut microbiome associated with Crohn’s disease, produces an inflammatory polysaccharide” | ATCC 29149 | Contextual (not a dedicated mucin‑growth assay) | States that *R. gnavus* “colonizes the intestinal mucosal surface, where it can **use sialic acid from mucin glycans as a carbon source**”, citing Crost 2013 and Tailford 2015[^1_12]. No new mucin growth curves, but reinforces the concept of mucin‑derived sialic acid fuelling growth. |
| Wu et al., PLOS Biology 2021 “The human gut symbiont *Ruminococcus gnavus* shows specificity to blood group A antigen during mucin glycan foraging” | E1 and others | Pig gastric mucin enriched for blood‑group A epitopes, and defined glycans[^1_13][^1_14] | Characterised GH98 endo‑β1,4‑galactosidase (RgGH98) targeting blood‑group A mucin glycans. Subsequent analysis (Sokolovskaya 2025) notes that **endo‑β1,4‑galactosidase activity enables strain E1, which otherwise cannot grow on pPGM, to use mucin as a growth substrate**[^1_14]. Demonstrates that provision of a specific CAZyme can convert a “non‑mucin‑degrader” into a mucin‑utiliser. |
| Kim et al., Gut Microbes 2023 “Genome‑wide multi‑omics analysis reveals the nutrient‑dependent metabolic features of mucin‑degrading gut bacteria” | ATCC 29149 | Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) ± mucin; defined medium (RD) ± mucin, fucose, galactose, etc.; hog gastric mucin[^1_15] | In rich medium, **TSB + mucin gave the highest specific growth rate**, and transcriptomics showed strong induction of sialidase (GH33) and fucose‑utilisation genes, indicating direct use of mucin‑derived neuraminate and fucose as nutrients[^1_15]. In a strictly defined medium with mucin as the only added carbon, *R. gnavus* “did not grow well”, highlighting dependence on additional nitrogen/energy sources in that formulation[^1_15]. |
| Sokolovskaya et al., Microbiol Spectrum 2025 “Dysbiosis‑associated gut bacterium *Ruminococcus gnavus* varies at the strain level in its ability to utilize key mucin component sialic acid” | 12 clinical isolates (including ATCC 29149) | Purified porcine gastric mucin (pPGM) as the **sole added carbon source** in basal YCFA[^1_14] | Screened 12 sequenced isolates: as previously reported, ATCC 29149 reached moderate density with pPGM alone. **All strains except one (RJX1126) grew with pPGM as the sole added carbon source**, despite large variation in sialic‑acid catabolic pathways[^1_14]. Shows that mucin utilisation is widespread across *R. gnavus* strains and not solely dependent on Nan‑mediated 2,7‑anhydro‑Neu5Ac catabolism. |
| Crost et al., FEMS Rev 2023 “*Ruminococcus gnavus*: friend or foe for human health” (review) | Summarises ATCC 29149, ATCC 35913, E1 | Integrates data from Hoskins 1985, Crost 2013, Crost 2016 and others[^1_16][^1_17][^1_18] | Explicitly states that **ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913, but not E1, can grow on mucin as sole carbon source**, and reviews the CAZyme clusters (IT‑sialidase, fucosidases, GH98) underpinning mucin glycan utilisation[^1_16][^1_17][^1_18]. |

## Interpretation

1. **Yes, *R. gnavus* can utilise mucin as a carbon source, but not all strains can grow on intact mucin.**
    - Early work with Ruminococcus AB VI‑268 (now ATCC 35913) showed growth on hog gastric mucin oligosaccharides as the only carbohydrate source.[^1_1][^1_2]
    - In modern strain‑resolved work, **ATCC 29149 and ATCC 35913 consistently grow on purified porcine gastric mucin as the sole added carbon source**, whereas strain E1 does not unless provided with an additional endo‑galactosidase activity.[^1_3][^1_7][^1_10][^1_6][^1_8][^1_14][^1_13]
    - Screening of 12 clinical isolates found **11/12 strains grew on pPGM** as sole added carbon, suggesting that mucin utilisation is common but not universal in this species.[^1_14]
2. **Mechanistically, mucin utilisation relies mainly on terminal mucin glycans.**
    - Mucin‑degrading strains express a suite of CAZymes: **IT‑sialidase (GH33), fucosidases (GH29/GH95), and in some cases GH98 endo‑β1,4‑galactosidase**, enabling release and uptake of terminal sialic acid, fucose and galactose from mucin O‑glycans.[^1_7][^1_6][^1_8][^1_13][^1_3]
    - Transcriptomics shows these genes (Nan cluster, GH33, GH29, GH95, GH98) are strongly upregulated when strains are grown on mucin compared to glucose, and mucin‑grown cells produce characteristic fermentation end‑products (acetate, formate, propanol/propionate) derived from mucin sugars.[^1_10][^1_8][^1_15][^1_7][^1_14]
3. **Medium formulation matters.**
    - In **basal YCFA** with mucin as the only added carbon source, mucin‑degrader strains grow well.[^1_3][^1_7][^1_10][^1_14]
    - In the **stringent defined medium** used by Kim et al., *R. gnavus* grew poorly when mucin was the only added carbon, but grew fastest in rich TSB + mucin, with clear transcriptional evidence that mucin‑derived neuraminate and fucose were being catabolised. This underscores that growth on “mucin alone” is sensitive to background nitrogen/energy sources in the medium.[^1_15]
4. **In vivo and ex vivo evidence is consistent with mucin foraging.**
    - Png et al. showed *R. gnavus* isolates degrade human MUC2 in pure culture and are enriched in IBD mucosa, defining them as mucolytic bacteria.[^1_11]
    - Monocolonisation of mice with ATCC 29149 leads to decreased sialic‑acid content in intestinal mucins, again consistent with active mucin glycan foraging in situ.[^1_19]

## Practical summary

If you are asking whether *R. gnavus* can **grow using mucin‑derived carbohydrates**, the answer is:

- **Yes, for most tested strains** (e.g. ATCC 29149, ATCC 35913 and the majority of recent clinical isolates), mucin glycans from porcine or hog gastric mucin can support growth as the main or sole added carbon source in appropriate basal media.[^1_2][^1_7][^1_10][^1_1][^1_14][^1_3]
- **No, for some strains** such as E1 in its native state; these lack key mucin‑degrading CAZymes (e.g. IT‑sialidase, certain fucosidases or GH98), but can be “rescued” by provision of additional mucin‑targeting enzymes.[^1_6][^1_13][^1_14][^1_3]

For experimental design, if you want to test mucin utilisation by a new *R. gnavus* isolate, the clearest precedents are:

- Growth assays in anaerobic basal YCFA with **1% purified porcine gastric mucin (pPGM) as the sole added carbon source**, following Crost 2013/2016 and Sokolovskaya 2025.[^1_8][^1_7][^1_10][^1_14][^1_3]
- Complementary transcriptomics/CAZyme profiling to confirm induction of Nan cluster, GH33, GH29/GH95 and, where present, GH98.[^1_13][^1_7][^1_6][^1_8][^1_15][^1_14]
